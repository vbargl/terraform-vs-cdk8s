# What is cdk8s?[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/#what-is-cdk8s "Permanent link")

**cdk8s** is a software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and rich object-oriented APIs. cdk8s generates pure Kubernetes YAML - you can use cdk8s to define applications for any Kubernetes cluster running anywhere.

Info

The documentation here relates to version `2.x` of the cdk8s toolchain, which is the latest. If you are still using version `1.x`, please refer to the [Migrating from 1.x Guide](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/migrating-from-1.x/).

![demo](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/assets/animation.gif)

Read [our blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-cdk-for-kubernetes/) or [watch our CNCF webinar](https://www.cncf.io/webinars/end-yaml-engineering-with-cdk8s/) to learn more and see a live demo of cdk8s in action.

## How does it work?[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/#how-does-it-work "Permanent link")

**cdk8s** apps are programs written in one of the supported programming languages. They are structured as a tree of[constructs](https://github.com/aws/constructs).

The root of the tree is an `App` construct. Within an app, users define any number of charts (classes that extend the `Chart` class). Each chart is synthesized into a separate Kubernetes manifest file. Charts are, in turn, composed of any number of constructs, and eventually from resources, which represent any Kubernetes resource, such as `Pod`, `Service`, `Deployment`,`ReplicaSet`, etc.

cdk8s apps only **_define_** Kubernetes applications, they don’t actually apply them to the cluster. When an app is executed, it _synthesizes_ all the charts defined within the app into the `dist` directory, and then those charts can be applied to any Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply -f dist/chart.k8s.yaml` or a GitOps tool like [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/).

> **cdk8s** is based on the design concepts and technologies behind the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk), and can interoperate with AWS CDK constructs to define cloud-native applications that include both Kubernetes resources and other CDK constructs as first class citizens.

# Getting started with cdk8s for Python[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#getting-started-with-cdk8s-for-python "Permanent link")

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the most essential concepts you need to know in order to build a Kubernetes application using cdk8s for Python.

## Prerequisites[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#prerequisites "Permanent link")

1. To install the cdk8s CLI, you need the [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your local machine.
2. cdk8s for Python supports Python versions 3.7+. Check your Python version:  
`python3 --version  
`

## Set up an environment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#set-up-an-environment "Permanent link")

### Initial setup[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#initial-setup "Permanent link")

To get setup, follow these general steps:

1. To begin, you’ll need pipenv 2018.11.26+ installed. If you’re not familiar with this setup, use these instructions to [setup pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/).

### Install the CLI[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#install-the-cli "Permanent link")

To initialize a cdk8s project and auto-generate Kubernetes manifests based on our code, we need the cdk8s CLI:

1. Run the following command to install the CLI using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). For more installation methods, see [Install the cdk8s CLI](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/installation/).  
`npm install -g cdk8s-cli  
`

### Create a project[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#create-a-project "Permanent link")

Next, we’ll initialize a project to create the directory structure and install the necessary dependencies using the [init](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/init/) command. 

1. In a terminal window, run the following command in an empty directory:  
`cdk8s init python-app  
`
2. In your preferred code editor, open the `main.py` file.  
`#!/usr/bin/env python  
from constructs import Construct  
from cdk8s import App, Chart  
class MyChart(Chart):  
   def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str):  
       super().__init__(scope, id)  
       # define resources here  
app = App()  
MyChart(app, "python")  
app.synth()  
`

This sample shows the basic structure of a cdk8s application with the essential libraries: **constructs** and **cdk8s**. These libraries supply the foundational classes and methods required for working with cdk8s. It includes the following components:

* A custom `MyChart` class inherits from the [Chart](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#chart) base class provided by the cdk8s library, serving as a representation of the Kubernetes resources to be generated and managed.
* The `__init__` method within the `MyChart` class is responsible for initializing the base class ([Chart](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#chart)) and specifying the Kubernetes resources. This method is invoked when creating an instance of the class.
* An instance of the [App](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#app) class signifies the primary entry point of the cdk8s application and oversees the application’s lifecycle and resources.
* An instance of the `MyChart` class is created by passing the app instance and a string identifier, “python”, as arguments. This action generates and registers the Kubernetes resources defined in the `MyChart` class within the application. Note that in this example, the “python” string identifier is autogenerated based on the current directory name.
* The `synth` method is called on the `app` instance, which produces the required Kubernetes YAML manifest files based on the defined resources. Note that in this example, we haven’t defined any resources within the `MyChart` constructor, so running the “cdk8s synth” command in the CLI would generate a blank Kubernetes manifest.

## Define Kubernetes resources[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#define-kubernetes-resources "Permanent link")

Now, we are ready to define Kubernetes resources for our application. In this sample, we define a basic Kubernetes [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) for a sample application. We start by importing the imports directory and the **k8s** sub-directory, which contains an `__init__.py` file where all cdk8s Kubernetes classes and functions are defined.

### Copy the code sample[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#copy-the-code-sample "Permanent link")

1. Copy and paste the following code sample into the existing `main.py` file of your project.  
`#!/usr/bin/env python  
from cdk8s import App, Chart  
from constructs import Construct  
from imports import k8s  
class MyChart(Chart):  
   def __init__(self, scope: Construct, ns: str, app_label: str):  
       super().__init__(scope, ns)  
       # Define a Kubernetes Deployment  
       k8s.KubeDeployment(self, "my-deployment",  
                       spec=k8s.DeploymentSpec(  
                           replicas=3,  
                           selector=k8s.LabelSelector(match_labels={"app": app_label}),  
                           template=k8s.PodTemplateSpec(  
                               metadata=k8s.ObjectMeta(labels={"app": app_label}),  
                               spec=k8s.PodSpec(containers=[  
                                   k8s.Container(  
                                       name="app-container",  
                                       image="nginx:1.19.10", # Using public nginx image  
                                       ports=[k8s.ContainerPort(container_port=80)] # Nginx listens on port 80 by default  
                                   )  
                               ])  
                           )  
                       )  
                   )  
app = App()  
MyChart(app, "getting-started", app_label="my-app")  
app.synth()  
`

A few things worth noting about this sample:

* The `__init__` method in the custom `MyChart` class uses idiomatic Python’s features to construct a Kubernetes Deployment. The Deployment is created with specific parameters including replica count, label selectors, and pod specifications. Just as in the custom `MyChart` class instantiation process, this approach utilizes Python’s flexible handling of dictionary data structures to dynamically assign the “app” key in label selectors and metadata labels for our Kubernetes resources, creating a clear and concise way to set key configuration details.

## Generate Kubernetes manifests[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#generate-kubernetes-manifests "Permanent link")

After you have defined the Kubernetes resources for your application, you are ready to generate the Kubernetes manifest that will define your Deployment resource. 

### Run the synth command[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#run-the-synth-command "Permanent link")

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the [synth](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/) command. This command generates a Kubernetes manifest file in the `dist` folder of your project directory. The manifest file contains all the resources you defined inside the `MyChart` class.  
`cdk8s synth  
`

### View the manifest[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#view-the-manifest "Permanent link")

1. Open the `dist/getting-started.k8s.yaml` file. You should see a Kubernetes manifest similar to the following:  
`apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
metadata:  
  name: getting-started-my-deployment-c85252a6  
spec:  
  replicas: 3  
  selector:  
    matchLabels:  
      app: my-app  
  template:  
    metadata:  
      labels:  
        app: my-app  
    spec:  
      containers:  
        - image: nginx:1.19.10  
          name: app-container  
          ports:  
            - containerPort: 80  
`

## Conclusion[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/python/#conclusion "Permanent link")

Throughout this guide, we introduced you to the cdk8s Python library and guided you through the process of creating a cdk8s Python application. We initiated a simple project and constructed a Kubernetes Deployment using cdk8s code. This included leveraging Python-specific programming language conventions to dynamically set the “app” key in “label” selectors and “metadata” labels for Kubernetes resources using Python’s versatile handling of dictionary data structures.

### Create a project[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/typescript/#create-a-project "Permanent link")

Next, we’ll initialize a project to create the directory structure and install the necessary dependencies using the [init](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/init/) command. 

1. In a terminal window, run the following command in an empty directory:  
`cdk8s init typescript-app  
`
2. In your preferred code editor, open the `main.ts` file.  
`import { Construct } from 'constructs';  
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';  
export class MyChart extends Chart {  
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {  
    super(scope, id, props);  
    // define resources here  
  }  
}  
const app = new App();  
new MyChart(app, 'typescript');  
app.synth();  
`

This sample shows the basic structure of a cdk8s application with the essential libraries: **constructs** and **cdk8s**. These libraries supply the foundational classes and methods required for working with cdk8s. It includes the following components:

* A custom `MyChart` class inherits from the [Chart](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#chart) base class provided by the cdk8s library, serving as a representation of the Kubernetes resources to be generated and managed.
* The `constructor` method within the MyChart class is responsible for initializing the base class ([Chart](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#chart)) and specifying the Kubernetes resources. This method is invoked when creating an instance of the class.
* An instance of the [App](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#app) class signifies the primary entry point of the cdk8s application and oversees the application’s lifecycle and resources.
* An instance of the `MyChart` class is created by passing the app instance and a string identifier, “typescript”, as arguments. This action generates and registers the Kubernetes resources defined in the `MyChart` class within the application. Note that in this example, the “typescript” string identifier is autogenerated based on the current directory name.
* The `synth` method is called on the `app` instance, which produces the required Kubernetes YAML manifest files based on the defined resources. Note that in this example, we haven’t defined any resources within the `MyChart` constructor, so running the “cdk8s synth” command in the CLI would generate a blank Kubernetes manifest.

## Define Kubernetes resources[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/typescript/#define-kubernetes-resources "Permanent link")

Now, let’s delve into defining Kubernetes resources for our application. In this example, we’ll outline a basic Kubernetes [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) for a sample app. We’ll start by importing the `imports` directory and the `k8s` sub-directory, which houses the `index.ts` file containing all cdk8s Kubernetes classes and functions.

### Copy the code sample[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/typescript/#copy-the-code-sample "Permanent link")

1. Copy and paste the following code sample into the existing `main.ts` file of your project.  
`import { Construct } from 'constructs';  
import { App, Chart } from 'cdk8s';  
import { KubeDeployment } from './imports/k8s';  
class MyChart extends Chart {  
  constructor(scope: Construct, ns: string, appLabel: string) {  
    super(scope, ns);  
    // Define a Kubernetes Deployment  
    new KubeDeployment(this, 'my-deployment', {  
      spec: {  
        replicas: 3,  
        selector: { matchLabels: { app: appLabel } },  
        template: {  
          metadata: { labels: { app: appLabel } },  
          spec: {  
            containers: [  
              {  
                name: 'app-container',  
                image: 'nginx:1.19.10',  
                ports: [{ containerPort: 80 }]  
              }  
            ]  
          }  
        }  
      }  
    });  
  }  
}  
const app = new App();  
new MyChart(app, 'getting-started', 'my-app');  
app.synth();  
`

A few things worth noting about this sample:

* The `constructor` method in the custom `MyChart` class employs TypeScript’s type system to construct a Kubernetes Deployment. This Deployment is configured with specific parameters, such as replica count, label selectors, and pod specifications. This approach leverages TypeScript’s type system to dynamically assign the “app” key in label selectors and metadata labels, creating a clear and concise way to set key configuration details.

## Generate Kubernetes manifests[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/typescript/#generate-kubernetes-manifests "Permanent link")

After you have defined the Kubernetes resources for your application, you are ready to generate the Kubernetes manifest that will define your Deployment resource. 

### Run the synth command[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/typescript/#run-the-synth-command "Permanent link")

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the [synth](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/) command. This command generates a Kubernetes manifest file in the `dist` folder of your project directory. The manifest file contains all the resources you defined inside the `MyChart` class.  
`cdk8s synth  
`

### View the manifest[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/typescript/#view-the-manifest "Permanent link")

1. Open the `dist/getting-started.k8s.yaml` file. You should see a Kubernetes manifest similar to the following:  
`apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
metadata:  
  name: getting-started-my-deployment-c85252a6  
spec:  
  replicas: 3  
  selector:  
    matchLabels:  
      app: my-app  
  template:  
    metadata:  
      labels:  
        app: my-app  
    spec:  
      containers:  
        - image: nginx:1.19.10  
          name: app-container  
          ports:  
            - containerPort: 80  
`

## Conclusion[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/typescript/#conclusion "Permanent link")

Throughout this guide, we introduced you to the cdk8s Typescript library and guided you through the process of creating a cdk8s Typescript application. We’ve initiated a simple project and crafted a Kubernetes Deployment using cdk8s code. This involved utilizing TypeScript’s strong type system to dynamically set the “app” key in label selectors and metadata labels for Kubernetes resources.

# Getting started with cdk8s for Java[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#getting-started-with-cdk8s-for-java "Permanent link")

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of building a basic Kubernetes application using cdk8s for Java.

## Prerequisites[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#prerequisites "Permanent link")

1. To install the cdk8s CLI, you need the [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your local machine.
2. cdk8s for Java supports Java Development Kit (JDK) versions 8+. Check your Java version:  
`java --version  
`

## Set up an environment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#set-up-an-environment "Permanent link")

### Initial setup[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#initial-setup "Permanent link")

To get setup, follow these general steps:

1. To begin, you’ll need Maven 3.6.3+ installed. If you’re not familiar with this setup, use these instructions to [setup Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

### Install the CLI[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#install-the-cli "Permanent link")

To initialize a cdk8s project and auto-generate Kubernetes manifests based on our code, we need the cdk8s CLI:

1. Run the following command to install the CLI using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). For more installation methods, see [Install the cdk8s CLI](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/installation/).  
`npm install -g cdk8s-cli  
`

### Create a project[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#create-a-project "Permanent link")

Next, we’ll initialize a project to create the directory structure and install the necessary dependencies using the [init](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/init/) command. 

1. In a terminal window, run the following command in an empty directory:  
`cdk8s init java-app  
`
2. In your preferred code editor, open the `Main.java` file.  
`package com.mycompany.app;  
import software.constructs.Construct;  
import org.cdk8s.App;  
import org.cdk8s.Chart;  
import org.cdk8s.ChartProps;  
public class Main extends Chart  
{  
    public Main(final Construct scope, final String id) {  
        this(scope, id, null);  
    }  
    public Main(final Construct scope, final String id, final ChartProps options) {  
        super(scope, id, options);  
        // define resources here  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        final App app = new App();  
        new Main(app, "java");  
        app.synth();  
    }  
}  
`

This sample shows the basic structure of a cdk8s application with the essential libraries: **constructs** and **cdk8s**. These libraries supply the foundational classes and methods required for working with cdk8s. It includes the following components:

* A custom `Main` class inherits from the [Chart](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#chart) base class provided by the cdk8s library, serving as a representation of the Kubernetes resources to be generated and managed.
* The `Main` constructor method is responsible for initializing the base class ([Chart](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#chart)) and specifying the Kubernetes resources. This method is invoked when creating an instance of the class.
* An instance of the [App](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#app) class is created in the `main` function, which acts the primary entry point of the cdk8s application and oversees the application’s lifecycle and resources.
* An instance of the `Main` class is created by passing the app instance and a string identifier, “java”, as arguments. This action generates and registers the Kubernetes resources defined in the `Main` class within the application. Note that in this example, the “java” string identifier is autogenerated based on the current directory name.
* The `synth` method is called on the `app` instance, which produces the required Kubernetes YAML manifest files based on the defined resources. Note that in this example, we haven’t defined any resources within the `Main` constructor, so running the “cdk8s synth” command in the CLI would generate a blank Kubernetes manifest.

## Define Kubernetes resources[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#define-kubernetes-resources "Permanent link")

Now, we are ready to define Kubernetes resources for our application. In this sample, we define a basic Kubernetes [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) for a sample application. We start by importing the `imports.k8s` sub-directory, which contains all the cdk8s Kubernetes classes and functions we’ll need. 

### Copy the code sample[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#copy-the-code-sample "Permanent link")

1. Copy and paste the following code sample into the existing `Main.java` file of your project.  
`package com.mycompany.app;  
import software.constructs.Construct;  
import org.cdk8s.App;  
import org.cdk8s.Chart;  
import org.cdk8s.ChartProps;  
import imports.k8s.Container;  
import imports.k8s.ContainerPort;  
import imports.k8s.DeploymentSpec;  
import imports.k8s.KubeDeployment;  
import imports.k8s.KubeDeploymentProps;  
import imports.k8s.LabelSelector;  
import imports.k8s.ObjectMeta;  
import imports.k8s.PodSpec;  
import imports.k8s.PodTemplateSpec;  
import java.util.Collections;  
import java.util.List;  
import java.util.Map;  
public class Main extends Chart {  
    public Main(final Construct scope, final String id, final String appLabel) {  
        this(scope, id, null, appLabel);  
    }  
    public Main(final Construct scope, final String id, final ChartProps props, final String appLabel) {  
        super(scope, id, props);  
        Map<String, String> label = Collections.singletonMap("app", appLabel);  
        new KubeDeployment(this, "my-deployment", KubeDeploymentProps.builder()  
                .spec(DeploymentSpec.builder()  
                        .replicas(3)  
                        .selector(LabelSelector.builder()  
                                .matchLabels(label)  
                                .build())  
                        .template(PodTemplateSpec.builder()  
                                .metadata(ObjectMeta.builder().labels(label)  
                                        .build())  
                                .spec(PodSpec.builder()  
                                        .containers(List.of(Container.builder()  
                                                .name("app-container-test")  
                                                .image("nginx:1.19.10")  
                                                .ports(List.of(ContainerPort.builder()  
                                                        .containerPort(80)  
                                                        .build()))  
                                                .build()))  
                                        .build())  
                                .build())  
                        .build())  
                .build());  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        final App app = new App();  
        new Main(app, "getting-started", "my-app");  
        app.synth();  
    }  
}  
`

A few things worth noting about this sample:

* The constructor in the custom `Main` class leverages Java’s object-oriented programming features to construct a Kubernetes Deployment. The Deployment is defined with specific parameters, including the number of replicas, label selectors, and pod specifications. This constructor employs Java’s strong typing and encapsulation to dynamically set the “app” key in label selectors and metadata labels for our Kubernetes resources, creating a clear and concise way to set key configuration details.

## Generate Kubernetes manifests[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#generate-kubernetes-manifests "Permanent link")

After you have defined the Kubernetes resources for your application, you are ready to generate the Kubernetes manifest that will define your Deployment resource. 

### Run the synth command[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#run-the-synth-command "Permanent link")

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the [synth](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/) command. This command generates a Kubernetes manifest file in the `dist` folder of your project directory. The manifest file contains all the resources you defined inside the `MyChart` class.  
`cdk8s synth  
`

### View the manifest[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#view-the-manifest "Permanent link")

1. Open the `dist/getting-started.k8s.yaml` file. You should see a Kubernetes manifest similar to the following:  
`apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
metadata:  
  name: getting-started-my-deployment-c85252a6  
spec:  
  replicas: 3  
  selector:  
    matchLabels:  
      app: my-app  
  template:  
    metadata:  
      labels:  
        app: my-app  
    spec:  
      containers:  
        - image: nginx:1.19.10  
          name: app-container  
          ports:  
            - containerPort: 80  
`

## Conclusion[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/java/#conclusion "Permanent link")

Throughout this guide, we introduced you to the cdk8s Java library and guided you through the process of creating a cdk8s Java application. We initiated a simple project and constructed a Kubernetes Deployment using cdk8s code. This included leveraging Java-specific programming language conventions to dynamically set the “app” key in “label” selectors and “metadata” labels for Kubernetes resources using Java’s versatile strong typing and encapsulation features.

# Getting started with cdk8s for Go[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#getting-started-with-cdk8s-for-go "Permanent link")

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of building a basic Kubernetes application using cdk8s for Go.

## Prerequisites[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#prerequisites "Permanent link")

1. To install the cdk8s CLI, you need the [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your local machine.
2. cdk8s for Go supports Go versions 1.16+. Check your Go version:  
`go version  
`

## Set up an environment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#set-up-an-environment "Permanent link")

### Install the CLI[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#install-the-cli "Permanent link")

To initialize a cdk8s project and auto-generate Kubernetes manifests based on our code, we need the cdk8s CLI:

1. Run the following command to install the CLI using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). For more installation methods, see [Install the cdk8s CLI](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/installation/).  
`npm install -g cdk8s-cli  
`

### Create a project[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#create-a-project "Permanent link")

Next, we’ll initialize a project to create the directory structure and install the necessary dependencies using the [init](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/init/) command. 

1. In a terminal window, create a new directory:  
`mkdir cdk8s-golang  
`
2. Next, run the following command inside the `cdk8s-golang` directory:  
`cdk8s init go-app  
`
3. In your preferred code editor, open the `main.go` file.  
`package main  
import (  
    "github.com/aws/constructs-go/constructs/v10"  
    "github.com/aws/jsii-runtime-go"  
    "github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core-go/cdk8s/v2"  
)  
type MyChartProps struct {  
    cdk8s.ChartProps  
}  
func NewMyChart(scope constructs.Construct, id string, props *MyChartProps) cdk8s.Chart {  
    var cprops cdk8s.ChartProps  
    if props != nil {  
        cprops = props.ChartProps  
    }  
    chart := cdk8s.NewChart(scope, jsii.String(id), &cprops)  
    // define resources here  
    return chart  
}  
func main() {  
    app := cdk8s.NewApp(nil)  
    NewMyChart(app, "cdk8s-golang", nil)  
    app.Synth()  
}  
`

This sample shows the basic structure of a cdk8s application with the essential libraries: **constructs** and **cdk8s**. These libraries supply the foundational classes and methods required for working with cdk8s. It includes the following components:

* A `NewMyChart` function that creates a specific instance of a [Chart](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core-go/cdk8s/v2#Chart). It is responsible for initializing the Chart instance and registering the Kubernetes resources to it.
* A `main` function acting as the primary entry point of the cdk8s application. It instantiates the [App](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core-go/cdk8s/v2#App) instance, which oversees the application’s lifecycle and resources.
* The function `NewMyChart` is called by passing the app instance and a string identifier, “go”, as arguments. This action generates and registers the chart and all its resources to the app. Note that in this example, the “cdk8s-golang” string identifier is autogenerated based on the current directory name.
* The `Synth` method is called on the `app` instance, which produces the required Kubernetes YAML manifest files based on the defined resources. Note that in this example, we haven’t defined any resources within the `NewMyChart` function, so running the “cdk8s synth” command in the CLI would generate a blank Kubernetes manifest.

## Define Kubernetes resources[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#define-kubernetes-resources "Permanent link")

Now, let’s delve into defining Kubernetes resources for our application. In this example, we’ll outline a basic Kubernetes [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) for a sample app. We’ll start by importing the `imports` directory and the `k8s` sub-directory, which houses all cdk8s Kubernetes classes and functions.

### Copy the code sample[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#copy-the-code-sample "Permanent link")

1. Copy and paste the following code sample into the existing `main.go` file of your project.

`package main

import (
    "example.com/cdk8s-golang/imports/k8s"
    "github.com/aws/constructs-go/constructs/v10"
    "github.com/aws/jsii-runtime-go"
    "github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core-go/cdk8s/v2"
)

func NewChart(scope constructs.Construct, id string, ns string, appLabel string) cdk8s.Chart {

    chart := cdk8s.NewChart(scope, jsii.String(id), &cdk8s.ChartProps{
        Namespace: jsii.String(ns),
    })

    labels := map[string]*string{
        "app": jsii.String(appLabel),
    }

    k8s.NewKubeDeployment(chart, jsii.String("deployment"), &k8s.KubeDeploymentProps{
        Spec: &k8s.DeploymentSpec{
            Replicas: jsii.Number(3),
            Selector: &k8s.LabelSelector{
                MatchLabels: &labels,
            },
            Template: &k8s.PodTemplateSpec{
                Metadata: &k8s.ObjectMeta{
                    Labels: &labels,
                },
                Spec: &k8s.PodSpec{
                    Containers: &[]*k8s.Container{{
                        Name:  jsii.String("app-container"),
                        Image: jsii.String("nginx:1.19.10"),
                        Ports: &[]*k8s.ContainerPort{{
                            ContainerPort: jsii.Number(80),
                        }},
                    }},
                },
            },
        },
    })

    return chart
}

func main() {
    app := cdk8s.NewApp(nil)

    NewChart(app, "getting-started", "default", "my-app")

    app.Synth()
}
`

A few things worth noting about this sample:

* The `NewChart` function utilizes Go’s strong typing and interface-based design to construct a Kubernetes Deployment. This Deployment is set up with specific parameters like replica count, label selectors, and pod specifications. This method takes advantage of Go’s map data structures to dynamically assign the “app” key in label selectors and metadata labels, offering a straightforward and efficient way to configure essential details.

## Generate Kubernetes manifests[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#generate-kubernetes-manifests "Permanent link")

After you have defined the Kubernetes resources for your application, you are ready to generate the Kubernetes manifest that will define your Deployment resource. 

### Run the synth command[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#run-the-synth-command "Permanent link")

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the [synth](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/) command. This command generates a Kubernetes manifest file in the `dist` folder of your project directory. The manifest file contains all the resources you defined inside the `MyChart` class.  
`cdk8s synth  
`

### View the manifest[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#view-the-manifest "Permanent link")

1. Open the `dist/getting-started.k8s.yaml` file. You should see a Kubernetes manifest similar to the following:  
`apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
metadata:  
  name: getting-started-deployment-c80c7257  
  namespace: default  
spec:  
  replicas: 3  
  selector:  
    matchLabels:  
      app: my-app  
  template:  
    metadata:  
      labels:  
        app: my-app  
    spec:  
      containers:  
        - image: nginx:1.19.10  
          name: app-container  
          ports:  
            - containerPort: 80  
`

## Conclusion[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/get-started/go/#conclusion "Permanent link")

Throughout this guide, we introduced you to the cdk8s Go library and guided you through the process of creating a cdk8s Go application. We initiated a simple project and constructed a Kubernetes Deployment using cdk8s code. This included leveraging Go-specific programming language conventions to dynamically set the “app” key in “label” selectors and “metadata” labels for Kubernetes resources using Go’s versatile handling of map data structures.

# Constructs[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/constructs/#constructs "Permanent link")

Constructs are the basic building block of **cdk8s**. They are the instrument that enables composition and creation of higher-level abstractions through normal object-oriented classes.

If you come from the Kubernetes world, you can think of constructs as programmatically defined Helm Charts. The nice thing about constructs being “programmatically defined” is that we can use them to leverage the full power of object-oriented programming. For example:

* You can express the abstraction’s API using strong-typed data types
* You can express rich interactions with methods and properties
* You can create polymorphic programming models through interfaces and base classes
* Share them through regular package managers
* Test them using our familiar testing tools and techniques
* Version them
* …and do all that stuff that we’ve been doing with software in the past 20 years.

# Chart[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/chart/#chart "Permanent link")

The `Chart` is a container that synthesizes a single Kubernetes manifest.

`class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, ns: string) {
    super(scope, ns);

    // add contents here
  }
}
`

During synthesis, charts collect all the `ApiObject` nodes (recursively) and emit a single YAML manifest that includes all these objects.

When a chart is defined, you can specify chart-level `namespace` and `labels`. Those will be applied to all API objects defined within the chart (recursively):

`class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, ns: string) {
    super(scope, ns, {
      namespace: 'my-namespace',
      labels: {
        app: 'my-app',
      },
    });

    new ApiObject(this, 'my-object', {
      apiVersion: 'v1',
      kind: 'Foo'
    });
  }
}
`

Will synthesize into:

`apiVersion: v1
kind: Foo
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  labels:
    app: my-app

# ApiObject[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/api-object/#apiobject "Permanent link")

An `ApiObject` is a construct that represents an entry in a Kubernetes manifest (level 0). In most cases, you won’t use `ApiObject` directly but rather use classes that are imported through `cdk8s import` and which extend this base class.

By default, when you import API objects from k8s, all class names will all be prefixed with `Kube` to differentiate them from the high-level APIs in cdk8s+. It is possible to customize the prefix by providing a string value to the`--class-prefix` flag, or by passing `--no-class-prefix`. (Note: if no prefix is used for k8s resources, this may lead to conflicts - see https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s/issues/140).

### Resource Names[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/api-object/#resource-names "Permanent link")

By default, cdk8s will autogenerate a name for every resource when it is instantiated. The name is created from the path of the construct, and suffixed with a hash of that path.

For example, the following code:

`import { App, Chart } from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new App();
const chart = new MyChart(app, 'my-chart');

new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'deployment', {
  containers: [{ image: 'nginx' }]
});

app.synth();
`

generates a `Deployment` with the name: `my-chart-deployment-c8c354dd`. Where `my-chart` is the id of the `Chart`, `deployment` is the id of the `Deployment`, and `c8c354dd` is the hash suffix.

You can programmatically access the name of any resource in a cdk8s app by accessing the `.name` property of a resource. For example:

`const deployment = new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'deployment', {
  containers: [{ image: 'nginx' }]
});
const deploymentName = deployment.name;
`

To remove hashes from resource names, you can set the `disableResourceNameHashes` property to `true`:

`...
const chart = new MyChart(app, 'my-chart', {
    disableResourceNameHashes: true,
});
...
`

Which would similarly generate a `Deployment` with the name: `my-chart-deployment`. Note that disabling hashes introduces the possibility of name clashes. For example, the following code: 

`// think of this as a custom construct
const c = new Construct(this, 'Construct');

new kplus.Deployment(c, 'Deployment', {
  containers: [{ image: 'image' }]
});

new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Construct-Deployment', {
  containers: [{ image: 'image' }]
})
`

will produce two deployments with the same name: `chart-construct-deployment`. This happens because cdk8s uses a hyphen (`-`) as the delimiter between elements in the path, so if the id of your construct also contains a hyphen (`-`), a collision can occur. In addition, you can explicitly set a name for every resource by using the `metadata.name` property:

`new kplus.Deployment(c, 'Deployment', {
  metadata: {
    name: 'my-deployment'
  },
  ...
});

# Dependencies[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/deps/#dependencies "Permanent link")

You can declare dependencies between any two cdk8s constructs using the `addDependency()` method.

### ApiObjects[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/deps/#apiobjects "Permanent link")

For example, you can force kubernetes to first apply a `Namespace` before applying the `Service` in the scope of that namespace:

`const namespace = new k8s.KubeNamespace(chart, 'backend');
const service = new k8s.KubeService(chart, 'Service', { metadata: { namespace: namespace.name }});

// declare the dependency. this is just a syntactic sugar for Node.of(service).addDependency(namespace)
service.addDependency(namespace);
`

`cdk8s` will ensure that the `Namespace` object is placed before the `Service` object in the resulting manifest:

`apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: chart-backend-a59d2e47
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: chart-service-93d02be7
  namespace: chart-backend-a59d2e47
`

### Charts[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/deps/#charts "Permanent link")

You can also specify dependencies between charts, in exactly the same manner. For example, if we have a chart that provisions our `namespace`, we need that chart to be applied first:

`const namespaceChart = new Chart(app, 'namespace');
const applicationChart = new Chart(app, 'application');

// declare the dependency. this is just a syntactic sugar for Node.of(applicationChart).addDependency(namespaceChart)
applicationChart.addDependency(namespaceChart);
`

Running `cdk8s synth` will produce the following `dist` directory:

`> cdk8s synth

dist/0000-namespace.k8s.yaml
dist/0001-application.k8s.yaml
`

Notice that the `namespace` chart appears first with the `0000` prefix. This will ensure that a subsequent execution of `kubectl apply -f dist/` will apply the `namespace` first, and the `application` second.

### Custom Constructs[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/deps/#custom-constructs "Permanent link")

The behavior above applies in the same way to custom constructs that you create or use.

`class Database extends Construct {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);

    new k8s.KubeStatefulSet(this, 'StatefulSet');
    new k8s.KubeConfigMap(this, 'ConfigMap');
  }
}

const app = new App();

const chart = new Chart(app, 'Chart');

const service = new k8s.KubeService(chart, 'Service')
const database = new Database(chart, 'Database');

service.addDependency(database);
`

Declaring such a dependency will cause **each** `ApiObject` in the source construct, to _depend on_ **every** `ApiObject` in the target construct.

Note that in the example above, the source construct is actually an `ApiObject`, which is also ok since it is essentially a construct with a single `ApiObject`.

> Note that if the source of your dependency is a custom construct, it won’t have the `addDependency` syntactic sugar by default, so you’ll have to use `Node.of()`.

The resulting manifest will be:

`apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: chart-database-statefulset-4627f8e2
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: chart-database-configmap-676f8640
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: chart-service-93d02be7
`

You can see that all `ApiObject`s of the `Database` construct, appear before the `Service` object.

### Things just got cool[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/deps/#things-just-got-cool "Permanent link")

If you simply declare a dependency between two `ApiObject`s (or `Constructs`), that belong to two different `Chart`s, `cdk8s` will create the chart dependency automatically for you.

`const namespaceChart = new Chart(app, 'namespace');
const applicationChart = new Chart(app, 'application');

const namespace = new k8s.KubeNamespace(namespaceChart, 'namespace');
const deployment = new k8s.KubeDeployment(applicationChart, 'Deployment');

// dependency between ApiObjects, not Charts!
deployment.addDependency(namespace);
`

Running `cdk8s synth` will produce the same result as if explicit chart dependencies were declared:

`> cdk8s synth

dist/0000-namespace.k8s.yaml
dist/0001-application.k8s.yaml
`

This means you need not be bothered with managing chart dependencies, simply work with the `ApiObject`s you create, and let `cdk8s` infer the chart dependencies.

# App[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/app/#app "Permanent link")

The `App` is the entry-point of your `cdk8s` application, and is the root of the constructs tree. Every application first starts by creating an instance of an `App`.

`import { App } from 'cdk8s';

const app = new App();
`

Then, [Charts](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/chart/) are registered into the app:

`new MyChart(app, 'Chart');
`

And finally, the `app` is synthesized in order to produce the YAML manifests. Overall, your `cdk8s`application will have the following high level structure to it:

`import { App } from 'cdk8s';

// create the app entry-point
const app = new App();

// register charts to the app
new MyChart(app, 'Chart');

// synthesize the app
app.synth();
`

## Resolvers[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/app/#resolvers "Permanent link")

Resolvers are a mechanism to inject custom logic into the cdk8s value resolution process. It allows to transform any value just before being written to the Kubernetes manifest. 

For example, lets create a resolver that adds a prefix to every resource in our application. To define a custom resolver, create a class that implements the `IResolver` interface:

`` import { IResolver, ResolutionContext } from 'cdk8s';

export class AddNamePrefixResolver implements IResolver {

  constructor(private readonly prefix: string) {}

  public resolve(context: ResolutionContext): void {

    // check if we are resolving the name property
    const isNameProperty = context.key.includes('metadata') && context.key.includes('name') && context.key.length === 2;

    // check we haven't already added a prefix. this is important because
    // resolution is recursive, so we need to avoid infinite recursion.
    const isPrefixed = typeof(context.value) === 'string' && context.value.startsWith(this.prefix);

    if (isNameProperty && !isPrefixed) {
      // replace the value with a new one
      context.replaceValue(`${this.prefix}${context.value}`);
    }
  }

}
 ``

The `context` argument contains information about the value that is currently being resolved:

* **obj**: `ApiObject` currently being resolved.
* **key**: Array containing the JSON path elements of the keys leading up to the value.
* **value**: The original value.

It also contains the `replaceValue` method you should use to set a replacement value instead of the original. When you create a cdk8s `App`, pass the resolver instance to it via the `resolvers` property:

`import { App, Chart } from 'cdk8s'

const app = new App({ resolvers: [new AddNamePrefixResolver('custom-prefix')] });
new Chart(app, 'Chart');
`

When you run `cdk8s synth`, your custom logic will be invoked, allowing you to replace the original value. 

> When passing multiple resolvers, the first one (by natural order of the array) that invokes `replaceValue` is considered, and others are ignored.

One common use-case for resolvers is to fetch values from deployed infrastructure. This allows authoring cdk8s applications that natively leverage managed cloud resources. To that end, two specific resolvers are available that allow you to integrate cdk8s with other CDK frameworks:

* [AWS CDK Resolver](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-awscdk-resolver)
* [CDK For Terraform Resolver](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-cdktf-resolver)

# Escape Hatches[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/escape-hatches/#escape-hatches "Permanent link")

An “escape hatch” is an intentional _leak_ in the abstraction layer. It allows users to “escape the abstraction” and reach out to a lower layer.

Similarly, in CDKs, escape hatches are mechanisms that allow users to tweak the synthesized output when the abstraction they use does not “hold water”.

You may need to use an escape hatch in the following cases:

1. You are using an imported API object (e.g. `KubeDeployment`) and there is an issue with the schema or a bug in “import” which results in an invalid manifest or missing fields (as an example see[issue #140](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s/issues/140)).
2. You are using a high-level API (e.g. cdk8s+) which does not expose some functionality which exists in the lower-level resources.

## Patching API objects directly[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/escape-hatches/#patching-api-objects-directly "Permanent link")

The [ApiObject](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/api-object/) class, which is the base of all objects synthesized into a Kubernetes manifest offers an API for patching the synthesized output at the wire level using JSON Patch ([RFC-6902](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)):

`import { JsonPatch } from 'cdk8s';
apiObject.addJsonPatch(JsonPatch.replace('/foo', 'bar'));
apiObject.addJsonPatch(JsonPatch.add('/foo/bar/0', { bar: 123 }));
`

During synthesis, patches are applied in-order after the API object synthesized itself.

All classes generated using the CLI [import](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/) command extend`ApiObject`, and therefore include the `addJsonPatch()` method.

## Patching API objects behind higher-level APIs[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/escape-hatches/#patching-api-objects-behind-higher-level-apis "Permanent link")

The second use case for using escape hatches is when you are working against a higher-level construct which, for some reason, does not allow you to achieve what you need.

For example, let’s say you are using the `Pod` class from cdk8s+ and you wish to set \[`enableServiceLinks`\] to `true`. This feature is currently not supported in the cdk8s+ `Pod` API, so you’ll want to patch the underlying `KubePod` and set this value.

To do that, you will need to “peak” into the construct tree and find the underlying API object, so you can apply the patch to it:

`import { Pod } from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import { ApiObject } from 'cdk8s';

const pod = new Pod(...);
const kubePod = ApiObject.of(pod);
kubePod.addJsonPatch(...);
`

The `ApiObject.of()` method uses capabilities of the [constructs programming model](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/constructs/) to find the “default child” of a construct (`Node.of(c).defaultChild`). When a construct is initialized, it can either explicitly assign the value of `Node.of(this).defaultChild = xxx` or it can use the identity `Default` for one of its child constructs. This will automatically identify it as the default child.

Tip

The `ApiObject.of()` method recursively searches down the construct tree through child constructs called `Default` until it finds a child of type`ApiObject`. This means, for example, that `ApiObject.of(apiObject)` returns the same object.

There could be situations where a default child is not recorded by a high-level construct. This still does not mean you are blocked from patching the underlying API objects. You can still use `Node.of(x)` to traverse the construct tree to obtain the child. For example, you can use `Node.of(x).findChild(id)` to retrieve any child by its ID.

# Helm Support[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/helm/#helm-support "Permanent link")

You can use the `Helm` construct in order to include [Helm](https://helm.sh)charts.

Note

You will need helm to be [installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) locally for this feature. For accessing private helm repositories, you must be authenticated to the repository in a way that the `helm pull` command recognizes.

The following example adds the[bitnami/redis](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis)Helm chart with sentinel containers enabled:

> The Bitnami helm repo needs to be added through: `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`
> 
> For accessing private helm repositories, you must be authenticated to the repository in a way that the `helm template`command recognizes.

`class MyChart extends cdk8s.Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    const redis = new Helm(this, 'redis', {
      chart: 'bitnami/redis',
      values: {
        sentinel: {
          enabled: true
        }
      }
    });
  }
}
`

The `Helm` construct will render the manifest from the specified chart by executing `helm template`. If `values` is specified, these values will override the default values included with the chart.

The `name` option can be used to specify the chart’s [release name](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using%5Fhelm/#three-big-concepts). If not specified, a valid and unique release name will be allocated based on the construct path.

The `Helm` construct extends `Include` and inherits it’s API. For example, you can use the `apiObjects` property to find and interact with included API objects.

The following example shows how to add an annotation to the Redis master deployment:

`const master = redis.apiObjects.find(o => o.name === 'foo-redis-master');
master.metadata.addAnnotation('my.annotation', 'hey-there');

# Include[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/include/#include "Permanent link")

The `Include` construct can be used to include an existing manifest in a chart.

The following example will include the Kubernetes Dashboard in `MyChart`:

`import { Include } from 'cdk8s';

class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    const dashboard = new Include(this, 'dashboard', {
      url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.4.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml',
      // or
      url: 'dashboard.yaml'
    });

    // ...other resources
  }
}
`

All API objects defined in the included manifest will be added as children`ApiObject`s under the `Include` construct’s scope and can be accessed through the `apiObject` property:

The following example queries for all the `Deployment` resources in the dashboard:

`const deploymentApiObject = dashboard.apiObjects.find(c => c.kind === 'Deployment');
`

NOTE: names of included objects (`metadata.name`) are preserved. This means that if you try to include the same manifest twice into the same chart, your manifest will have duplicate definitions of the same objects.

# cdk8s+[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/#cdk8s "Permanent link")

**cdk8s+** is a library with high level abstractions for authoring Kubernetes applications.

Built on top of the auto-generated building blocks provided by cdk8s, this library includes a hand crafted _construct_ for each native kubernetes object, exposing richer API’s with reduced complexity.

Info

The documentation here relates to version `2.x` of the cdk8s toolchain, which is the latest. If you are still using version `1.x`, please refer to the [Migrating from 1.x Guide](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/migrating-from-1.x/).

Here is an example of how we would deploy a simple nginx container, once with the low-level API (on the left), and once with the high level abstraction (on the right).

![corevsplus](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/assets/corevsplus.png)

### Spec compatibility[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/#spec-compatibility "Permanent link")

**cdk8s+** is vended as a separate library for each kubernetes spec version. Follow the pane on the left to navigate to the appropriate version you need. Per kubernetes [compatibility guarantees](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning), **stable** resources in a `cdk8s-plus-XX` library are compatible with any spec version higher or equal to `1.XX.0`. **Non-stable** resources are not guaranteed to be compatible, as they may be removed in future spec versions.

Notice

cdk8s+ libraries are maintained only for the 3 latest Kubernetes releases. So, if the latest Kubernetes release is N, `cdk8s-plus-N`, `cdk8s-plus-(N-1)` and `cdk8s-plus-(N-2)` will be continously updated and supported. However, `cdk8s-plus-(N-3)` and so on will no longer be actively maintained.

### Naming conventions[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/#naming-conventions "Permanent link")

* Stable resources are represented by a _construct_ of the same _kind_. For example, the `io.k8s.api.core.v1.Pod` resource maps to the `Pod` _construct_.
* Non stable resources are suffixed with their _api version_. For example, the `io.k8s.api.networking.v1beta1.Ingress` maps to the `IngressV1Beta1` _construct_.

## FAQ[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/#faq "Permanent link")

### I operate Kubernetes version `1.XX` \- which cdk8s+ library should I be using?[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/#i-operate-kubernetes-version-1xx-which-cdk8s-library-should-i-be-using "Permanent link")

If there is a `cdk8s-plus-XX` library that matches your target Kubernetes version, we recommend using it since all Kubernetes manifests generated using it will be compatible.

If there is not a matching `cdk8s-plus-XX` library, we recommend using the closest matching version. The manifests generated by `cdk8s-plus-XX` may also work for older versions of Kubernetes, but you might encounter some unsupported spec properties or invalid manifests.

### I’m using `cdk8s-plus-XX` \- which kubernetes versions will my manifest work on?[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/#im-using-cdk8s-plus-xx-which-kubernetes-versions-will-my-manifest-work-on "Permanent link")

If you are using stable APIs (those that are not in alpha or beta), manifests generated in `cdk8s-plus-XX` will work in Kubernetes versions `1.XX.0` and above. Unstable APIs (which are always labeled in cdk8s+ using a suffix, e.g.`IngressV1Beta1`) may work in newer versions of Kubernetes, but it is also possible they have been removed.

The manifests generated by `cdk8s-plus-XX` may also work for older versions of Kubernetes, but you might encounter some unsupported spec properties or invalid manifests.

## Overcoming Coverage Gaps[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/#overcoming-coverage-gaps "Permanent link")

As mentioned, the APIs offered by **cdk8s+** are hand-written by the team as well as the community. As such, you might encounter coverage gaps from time to time; that is, you are trying to configure something but the API doesn’t expose it. There are two kinds of gaps:

### Missing Resource[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/#missing-resource "Permanent link")

When an entire resource is missing, you can supplement it by dropping to the L1 layer of constructs, which are available from within **cdk8s+**, so you don’t need to install an additional library, or [import](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/) any resources. For example:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';

const app = new cdk8s.App();
const chart = new cdk8s.Chart(app, 'Chart');

// a Deployment exists as a higher level objects,
// so we use it.
new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'Deployment', {
  replicas: 3,
  containers: [{
    image: 'ubuntu',
  }],
});

// a StorageClass doesn't, so we use the low level objects.
// notice the '.k8s.' addition.
new kplus.k8s.KubeStorageClass(chart, 'StorageClass', {
  provisioner: 'kubernetes.io/aws-ebs'
});

app.synth();
`

# ConfigMap[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/config-map/#configmap "Permanent link")

ConfigMap are used to store configuration data. They provide a dictionary based data structure that can be consumed in various shapes and forms.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#configmap)

## Use an existing `ConfigMap`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/config-map/#use-an-existing-configmap "Permanent link")

You can reference to an existing `ConfigMap` like so. Note that this does not create a new object, and will therefore not be included in the resulting manifest.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: ChartProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const config: kplus.IConfigMap = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName(this, 'ConfigMap', 'config');

    // the 'config' constant can later be used by API's that require an IConfigMap.
    // for example when creating a volume.
    kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(this, 'Volume', config);
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'VolumeFromConfigMap');
app.synth();
`

## Adding data[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/config-map/#adding-data "Permanent link")

You can create config maps and add some data to them like so:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: ChartProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const config = new kplus.ConfigMap(this, 'Config');
    config.addData('url', 'https://my-endpoint:8080');
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'ConfigMap');
app.synth();
`

## Creating a volume from a directory[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/config-map/#creating-a-volume-from-a-directory "Permanent link")

Here is a nifty little trick you can use to create a volume that contains a directory on the client machine (machine that runs `cdk8s synth`):

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import * as path from 'path';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: ChartProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    const appMap = new kplus.ConfigMap(this, 'Config');

    // add the files in the directory to the config map.
    // this will create a key for each file.
    // note: this directory needs to exist
    // note: that only top level files will be included, sub-directories are not yet supported.
    appMap.addDirectory(path.join(__dirname, 'app'));

    const appVolume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(this, 'ConfigMap', appMap);

    const mountPath = '/var/app';
    const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
    const container = pod.addContainer({
      image: 'node',
      command: [ 'node', 'app.js' ],
      workingDir: mountPath,
    });

    // from here, just mount the volume to a container, and run your app!
    container.mount(mountPath, appVolume);
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'AppWithDir');
app.synth();

# Container[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/container/#container "Permanent link")

Define containers that run in a pod using the `Container` class.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#container)

## Environment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/container/#environment "Permanent link")

A container’s environment can be populated by various methods.

### Variables[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/container/#variables "Permanent link")

Environment variables can be added to containers by specifying the variable name and value. The value can come from different sources, either dynamic or static.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
    const container = pod.addContainer({
      image: 'my-app'
    });

    // use a static value.
    container.env.addVariable('endpoint', kplus.EnvValue.fromValue('value'));

    // use a specific key from a config map.
    const backendsConfig = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName(this, 'BackendConfig', 'backends');
    container.env.addVariable('endpoint', kplus.EnvValue.fromConfigMap(backendsConfig, 'endpoint'));

    // use a specific key from a secret.
    const credentials = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName(this, 'Credentials', 'credentials');
    container.env.addVariable('password', kplus.EnvValue.fromSecretValue({ secret: credentials, key: 'password' }));
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'container');
app.synth();
`

### Sources[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/container/#sources "Permanent link")

Environment variables can also be populated by referencing other objects as an environment source. With this method, all the key-value data of the source is added as environment variables, where the key is the env name and the value is the env value.

`const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
const cm = new kplus.ConfigMap(this, 'ConfigMap', {
  data: {
    key: 'value',
  }
});
const container = pod.addContainer({
  image: 'my-app'
});

// this will add 'key=value' env variable at runtime.
container.env.copyFrom(kplus.Env.fromConfigMap(cm));
`

## Volume Mounts[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/container/#volume-mounts "Permanent link")

A very common capability is to mount a volume with some data onto a container. Using pure kubernetes API, this would require writing something like:

`kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: main
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /path/to/mount
          name: 'config-volume'
  volumes:
    - name: 'config-volume'
      configMap:
        name: 'config'
`

Notice the apparent redundancy of having to specify the volume name twice. Also, if you happen to need the same mount in other pods, you would need to duplicate this configuration. This can get complex and cluttered very fast.

In contrast, here is how to do this with `cdk8s+`:

`const config = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName(this, 'Config', 'config');
const volume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(this, 'Volume', config);

const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
const container = pod.addContainer({
  image: 'my-app'
})

// Cool alert: every pod that will later be configured with this container,
// will automatically have access to this volume, so you don't need to explicitly add it to the pod spec!.
container.mount('/path/to/mount', volume);
`

## Probes[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/container/#probes "Permanent link")

A [Probe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#probe-v1-core) is a diagnostic performed periodically by the kubelet on a Container. To perform a diagnostic, the kubelet calls a Handler implemented by the container.

A `Probe` instance can be created through one of the `fromXxx` static methods:

* `Probe.fromHttpGet()`
* `Probe.fromCommand()`

Readiness, liveness, and startup probes can be configured at the container-level through the `readiness`, `liveness`, and `startup` options:

`new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod', {
  containers: [
    {
      image: 'my-app',
      readiness: kplus.Probe.fromHttpGet('/ping'),
    }
  ]
});
`

# CronJob[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/cronjob/#cronjob "Permanent link")

CronJob resource is responsible for creating recurring [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/). The job recurrence is determined by a [Cron](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/blob/2.x/src/cron.ts) expression.

CronJob is similar to a [job](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/job/) but it is suitable when there is a need to run a job indefinitely following a schedule. These repetitive jobs can be utilized for recurring tasks such as backing up a database, pinging a server for health checks, creating snapshots of systems and much more.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cronjob)

## Creating a `CronJob`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/cronjob/#creating-a-cronjob "Permanent link")

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps, Cron } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new kplus.CronJob(this, 'CronJob', {
      containers: [{
        image: 'databack/mysql-backup',
      }],
      // You can pass a custom cron schedule using our Cron class
      schedule: Cron.schedule({
        minute: '*',
        hour: '*',
        day: '*',
        month: '*',
        weekDay: '*',
      }),
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'cronjob-readme');
app.synth();
`

### Defaults[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/cronjob/#defaults "Permanent link")

The above would create a cronjob resource which would schedule `databack/mysql-backup` to run every minute. With this resource, we also set some meaningful defaults. For instance, this cronjob would not run jobs concurrently by default. It will also retain 3 instance of successful job runs and 1 instance of a failed run for debugging later if needed. To customize the properties, see [API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cronjob).

### Helper Functions[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/cronjob/#helper-functions "Permanent link")

As we see in the previous example, we can pass custom cron expression for scheduling our jobs. But, we have also have added helper functions that would make it easy to mention some of the commonly used schedules. These include scheduling jobs to run every minute, hour, day, week, month or year. For instance, the same example mentioned before could be written as,

`new kplus.CronJob(this, 'CronJob', {
  containers: [{
    image: 'databack/mysql-backup',
  }],
  // This would schedule jobs to be scheduled to run every minute
  schedule: Cron.everyMinute(),
});
`

### Validations[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/cronjob/#validations "Permanent link")

The cronjob construct also validates some of the properties so that the manifest created works as expected.

* You cannot pass `startingDeadline` property value less that 10 seconds. This is because the Kubernetes CronJobController checks things every 10 seconds and if the value passed is less than that then the jobs would not be scheduled.
* `ttlAfterFinished` job property limits the lifetime of a job that has finished execution. You cannot pass the `ttlAfterFinished` property with any/both of the `successfulJobsRetained` and `failedJobsRetained` property since this would not let retention of jobs work in an expected manner.

# Deployment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/deployment/#deployment "Permanent link")

Create a deployment to govern the lifecycle and orchestration of a set of identical pods.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#deployment)

## Automatic pod selection[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/deployment/#automatic-pod-selection "Permanent link")

When you specify pods in a deployment, you normally have to configure the appropriate labels and selectors to make the deployment control the relevant pods. This construct does this automatically.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new kplus.Deployment(this, 'FrontEnds', {
      containers: [ { image: 'node' } ],
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'deployment');
app.synth();
`

Note the resulting manifest contains a special `cdk8s.io/metadata.addr` label that is applied to the pods, and is used as the selector for the deployment.

`apiVersion: apps/v1

metadata:
  name: deployment-frontends-c8e48310
spec:

  progressDeadlineSeconds: 600

`

## Exposing via a service[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/deployment/#exposing-via-a-service "Permanent link")

Following up on pod selection, you can also easily create a service that will select the pods relevant to the deployment.

`// store the deployment to created in a constant
const frontends = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'FrontEnds', {
  containers: [ {
    image: 'node',
    portNumber: 9000,
  } ],
});

// create a ClusterIP service that listens on port 9000 and redirects to port 9000 on the containers.
frontends.exposeViaService({ ports: [{
  port: 9000,
}]
});
`

Notice the resulting manifest, will have the same `cdk8s.io/metadata.addr` magic label as the selector. This will cause the service to attach to the pods that were configured as part of the said deployment.

## Scheduling[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/deployment/#scheduling "Permanent link")

In addition to the scheduling capabilities provided by [pod scheduling](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#scheduling), a Deployment offers the following:

### Spreading[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/deployment/#spreading "Permanent link")

A spread is a [separation](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#pod-separation) of pods from themselves. It can be used to ensure replicas of the same workload are scheduled on different topologies.

> The same API is also available on all workload resources (i.e `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, `DaemonSet`).

`const redis = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }],
  replicas: 3,
});

redis.scheduling.spread({
  topology: kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME
});
`

This example ensures that each replica of the `Redis` deployment will be scheduled on a different node.

Take, for [example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#more-practical-use-cases), a three-node cluster running a web application with an in-memory cache like redis. You’d like to co-locate the web servers with the cache as much as possible, while still maintaining node failure resistance. (i.e not all pods are on the same node).

Here is how you can accomplish that:

`const redis = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }],
  replicas: 3,
});

const web = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
  replicas: 3,
});

// ensure redis is spread across all nodes
redis.scheduling.spread({
  topology: kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME
});

// ensure web app is spread across all nodes
web.scheduling.spread({
  topology: kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME
});

// ensure a web app pod always runs along side a cache instance
web.scheduling.colocate(redis);
`

# HorizontalPodAutoscaler[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#horizontalpodautoscaler "Permanent link")

HorizontalPodAutoscaler allows your services to scale up when demand is high and scale down when they are no longer needed.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#horizontalpodautoscaler)

## Using a HorizontalPodAutoscaler[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#using-a-horizontalpodautoscaler "Permanent link")

The example below creates a HorizontalPodAutoscaler that scales the number of replicas of a Deployment based on the average CPU utilization of the pods.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

// Lets create a deployment for our web server
const bookstoreWebsite = new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'BookstoreWebsite', {
  containers: [ { image: 'node' } ],
});

// Now define a HorizontalPodAutoscaler
const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.resourceCpu(kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(70)),
  ],
 });
// This will scale our website deployment up when the average CPU utilization
// is 70% or higher up to a maximum of 10 replicas.
`

Using the example above, if our web server passes 70% CPU utilization the autoscaler will try and figure out the number of replicas to scale.

The autoscaler uses the following formula:

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[currentReplicas \* ( currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue )\]

Based on this formula we can find out how many replicas will be scaled. For example if we have 1 replica and the CPU utilization is at 70%.

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[1 \* ( 70 / 70 )\] = 1

The autoscaler will try and add 1 replica, meaning we’ll have 2 web servers running, the original and the new replica.

If the CPU utilization is 140% the autoscaler will try and provision 2 replicas. Scaling us up to 3 web servers total.

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[1 \* ( 140 / 70 )\] = 2

This works the same way when scaling down.

For example if our target CPU utilization is 70% and we have 3 replicas running and the CPU utilization is at 50%.

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[3 \* ( 50 / 70 )\] = 2

The autoscaler will try and remove 1 replica, meaning we’ll have 2 web servers running, the original and the new replica.

## Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#metrics "Permanent link")

The HorizontalPodAutoscaler supports the following metrics:

### Resource Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#resource-metrics "Permanent link")

Resource metrics are used to scale on a resource like CPU or memory.

Since the resource usages of all the containers are summed up the total pod utilization may not accurately represent the individual container resource usage. This could lead to situations where a single container might be running with high usage and the HPA will not scale out because the overall pod usage is still within acceptable limits.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.resourceCpu(kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(70)),
  ],
 });
`

### Pods Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#pods-metrics "Permanent link")

Pods metrics are used to scale on a metric describing each pod in the current scale target (for example, transactions-processed-per-second).

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.pods({
      name: 'requests-per-second',
      target: kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(50),
      labelSelector: kplus.LabelSelector.of({ labels: { app: 'scraper' } }),
    }),
  ],
 });
`

## Container Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#container-metrics "Permanent link")

Container metrics are used to scale on one of the scaling target’s container metrics.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.containerMemory(kplus.MetricTarget.value(4096)),
  ],
 });
`

### Object Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#object-metrics "Permanent link")

Object metrics are used to scale on a metric describing a single kubernetes object (for example, requests-per-second on an Ingress object).

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.object({
        object: ingress,
        name: 'requests-per-second',
        target: kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(50),
      }),
  ],
});
`

### External Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#external-metrics "Permanent link")

External metrics are used to scale on a metric not associated with any Kubernetes object (for example, an SQS queue).

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
    kplus.Metric.external({
      labelSelector: kplus.LabelSelector.of({ labels: { app: 'scraper' } }),
      name: 'sqs-queue',
      target: kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(50),
    }),
  ],
 });
`

## Scaling behavior[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#scaling-behavior "Permanent link")

The HorizontalPodAutoscaler has a few options to control the scaling behavior.

### scaleUp /scaleDown[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#scaleup-scaledown "Permanent link")

The `scaleUp` / `scaleDown` options controls how fast the HorizontalPodAutoscaler scales up and down. They share the same options but have slightly different defaults.

`const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  scaleUp: {
    stabilizationWindow: 60,
    policies: [
      kplus.PolicyType.pods(4),
      kplus.PolicyType.percent(200),
    ],
  },
  scaleDown: {
    stabilizationWindow: 60,
    policies: [
      kplus.PolicyType.pods(2),
      kplus.PolicyType.percent(100),
    ],
  },
 });
`

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                     | scaleUp Default                                                                            | scaleDown Default                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stabilizationWindow | Defines the window of past metrics that the autoscaler should consider when calculating wether or not autoscaling should occur. | 5 minutes                                                                                  | 0 (no stabilization is performed)                                                         |
| strategy            | Determines if the the Autoscaler should scale as much or as little as possible.                                                 | ScalingStrategy.MAX\_CHANGE Choose the scaling policy that will scale the most replicas.   | ScalingStrategy.MIN\_CHANGE Choose the scaling policy that will scale the least replicas. |
| policies            | Defines how many replicas are scaled. Can be an absolute number or a percentage of the current replica count.                   | \* Increase no more than 4 pods per 60 seconds \* Double the number of pods per 60 seconds | \* Decrease to minReplica count (default 1)                                               |

Check out the example below. We have a `scaleUp` policy that will scale up by 4 pods or double the current number of pods per 60 seconds. Because the `strategy` has been configured to `ScalingStrategy.MAX_CHANGE` the autoscaler will choose the policy that will make the most replicas.

`const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.resourceCpu(kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(70)),
  ],
  scaleUp: {
    strategy: kplus.ScalingStrategy.MAX_CHANGE,
    stabilizationWindow: 60,
    policies: [
      kplus.PolicyType.pods(4),
      kplus.PolicyType.percent(200),
    ],
  },
 });
`

This means that if we currently have 3 web server pods, and the CPU utilization is at 72% the autoscaler will try and add 6 pods every 60 seconds.

This will result in a total of 9 web server pods. If after 60 seconds the CPU utilization is still at 72% the autoscaler will only be allowed to add one more replica because `maxReplicas` has been configured to 10.

# Ingress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/ingress/#ingress "Permanent link")

[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) manages external access to services in a cluster, typically through HTTP. Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#ingressv1beta1)

You must have an [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers) to satisfy an Ingress. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect.

The following example will route HTTP requests sent to the `/hello` url prefix to a service associated with a deployment of the[hashicorp/http-echo](https://github.com/hashicorp/http-echo) image.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const helloDeployment = new kplus.Deployment(this, "Deployment", {
      containers: [
        {
          image: 'hashicorp/http-echo',
          args: [ '-text', 'hello ingress' ],
          portNumber: 5678,
        }
      ]
    });

    const helloService = helloDeployment.exposeViaService({
        ports: [
          {
            port: 5678,
          }
        ]
      });

    const ingress = new kplus.Ingress(this, 'ingress');
    ingress.addRule('/hello', kplus.IngressBackend.fromService(helloService));
 }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'ingress');
app.synth();
`

You can use `addHostRule(host, path, backend)` to define a route that will only apply to requests with this `Host` header. This can be used to implement virtual hosts.

The `addDefaultBackend(backend)` and `addHostDefaultBackend(host, backend)`methods can be used to define backends that will accept all requests that do not match any other rules.

The TCP port used to route requests to services will be determined based on which ports are exposed by the service (e.g. through `serve()`). If the service exposes multiple ports, then a port must be specified via`IngressBackend.fromService(service, { port })`.

# Job[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/job/#job "Permanent link")

Jobs are a very useful concept in kubernetes deployments. They can be used for add-hoc provisioning tasks, as well as long running processing jobs.

In configuration, they don’t differ much from regular pods, but offer some additional properties.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#job)

## Delete a Job after its finished[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/job/#delete-a-job-after-its-finished "Permanent link")

You can configure a TTL for the job after it finished its execution successfully.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps, Duration } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // let's define a job spec, and set a 1 second TTL.
    const job = new kplus.Job(this, 'LoadData', {
      ttlAfterFinished: Duration.seconds(1)
    });

    // now add a container to all the pods created by this job
    job.addContainer({
      image: 'loader'
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'Job');
app.synth();
`

## Scheduling[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/job/#scheduling "Permanent link")

See [Deployment scheduling](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/deployment/#scheduling).

## Connections[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/job/#connections "Permanent link")

# Namespace[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/namespace/#namespace "Permanent link")

Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#namespace)

## Create a `Namespace`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/namespace/#create-a-namespace "Permanent link")

To create a new namespace in the cluster:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const namespace = new kplus.Namespace(chart, 'BackOfficeNamespace');
`

Like any other resource, if you don’t specify a name, cdk8s will auto-generate one, which you can access by `namespace.name`.

## Select namespaces[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/namespace/#select-namespaces "Permanent link")

Namespaces can also be selected by various mechanisms. These selections are often used in other cdk8s+ API’s, such as [pod selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#pod-selection) during scheduling.

### Select namespaces by name[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/namespace/#select-namespaces-by-name "Permanent link")

Select a namespace called `backoffice`.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const backoffice = kplus.Namespaces.select(this, 'Backoffice', { names: ['backoffice'] });
`

### Select namespace by labels[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/namespace/#select-namespace-by-labels "Permanent link")

Select all namespaces that have the `processing=batch` label.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const batch = kplus.Namespaces.select(this, 'Batch', { labels: { processing: 'batch'} });
`

### Select all namespaces[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/namespace/#select-all-namespaces "Permanent link")

Select all namespaces in the cluster.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const all = kplus.Namespaces.all();

# Network Policy[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#network-policy "Permanent link")

Network policies control inter-pod traffic flow at the IP address or port level (OSI layer 3 or 4). By default, a pod is opened in the network (or _non-isolated_). That is, it can initiate any outgoing traffic, and accept any incoming traffic.

When network policies are applied to pods, they lose this default behavior and become restricted, or _isolated_. This means that as soon as a policy in a specific direction applies to a pod, that pod stops being open in that direction. We refer to such pods as **isolated**. There are two sorts of isolation for a pod: isolation for egress, and isolation for ingress.

Network policies do not conflict; they are additive. If any policy or policies apply to a given pod for a given direction, the connections allowed in that direction from that pod is the union of what the applicable policies allow. Thus, order of evaluation does not affect the policy result.

For a connection from a source pod to a destination pod to be allowed, both the egress policy on the source pod and the ingress policy on the destination pod need to allow the connection. If either side does not allow the connection, it will not happen.

## Create a `NetworkPolicy`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#create-a-networkpolicy "Permanent link")

A network policy is a namespaced resource that applies to specific pods in that namespace. The pods are specified using the `selector` property, and can accept a few different objects:

### Managed Pod[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#managed-pod "Permanent link")

A managed pod is a pod that is created by the current cdk8s application. That is, its simply an instance of a `Pod`. You can pass that instance to be used as the selector. The policy will be applied only to that **specific** pod.

> Under the hood, this uses a magic `cdk8s.io/metadata.address` label that uniquely identifies pods, and is added automatically by cdk8s.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', { selector: web });
`

### Managed Workload[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#managed-workload "Permanent link")

Exactly as for a managed `Pod`, you can pass an instance of any workload resource (e.g `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, …)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', { selector: web });
`

### Selected Pods[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#selected-pods "Permanent link")

If you’d like to create a policy for pods that aren’t managed by the current cdk8s application, you use [selected pods](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#select-pods).

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = kplus.Pods.select(chart, 'Web', { labels: { app: 'web' }});

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', { selector: web });
`

This policy will apply to **all** pods with label `app=web`.

## Ip Block[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#ip-block "Permanent link")

An Ip Block defines a range of IP addresses using CIDR notation. You can define both `ipv4` and `ipv6` ranges:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

// define a specific ipv4 range
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.ipv4('172.17.0.0/16');

// define a specific ipv6 range
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.ipv6('2002::1234:abcd:ffff:c0a8:101/64');

// define all ipv4 addresses
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.anyIpv4();

// define all ipv6 addresses
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.anyIpv6();
`

Ip blocks can later be used as network policy [peers](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#peers).

## Peers[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#peers "Permanent link")

The selector of a policy is defined at construction time and there can only be one per policy. The peers constitute the second half of the connection – they are the resources or endpoints that the **selected** resources can communicate with. A policy can define rules for multiple peers, and a peer can be any one of:

* [Ip Block](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#ip-block): Will allow a connection with a CIDR range.
* [Managed Pod](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#managed-pod): Will establish a connection with specific pod.
* [Managed Workload](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#managed-workload): Will establish a connection with the pods of the workload.
* [Selected Pods](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#selected-pods): Will establish a connection with the selected pods.
* [Managed Namespace](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/namespace/): Will establish a connection with all pods in a specific namespace.
* [Selected Namespaces](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/namespace/#select-namespaces): Will establish a connection with all pods in the selected namespaces.

> You can also create a custom peer by implementing the `kplus.INetworkPolicyPeer` interface.

## Egress Rule[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#egress-rule "Permanent link")

Isolating pods for egress traffic egress can be done either at, or post construction:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

const cache = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Cache', {
  containers: [{ image: 'cache', portNumber: 6379 }],
});

const db = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'DB', {
  containers: [{ image: 'db', portNumber: 6378 }],
});

// create a policy with an egress rule at instantiation
const webPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  selector: web,
  egress: { rules: [{ peer: cache, ports: [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]}] },
});

// add an egress rule post instantiation
webPolicy.addEgressRule(db, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6378)]);
`

## Ingress Rule[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#ingress-rule "Permanent link")

Isolating pods for ingress traffic ingress can be done either at, or post construction:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

const cache = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Cache', {
  containers: [{ image: 'cache', portNumber: 6379 }],
});

const db = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'DB', {
  containers: [{ image: 'db', portNumber: 6378 }],
});

// create a policy with an ingress rule at instantiation
const dbPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  selector: db,
  ingress: { rule: [{ peer: web, ports: [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]}] },
});

// add an ingress rule post instantiation
redis.addIngressRule(cache, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]);
`

## Bi-directional Rule[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#bi-directional-rule "Permanent link")

As mentioned earlier, for a connection from a source pod to a destination pod to be allowed, both the egress policy on the source pod and the ingress policy on the destination pod need to allow the connection. Using network policies, this could be tricky, especially if the pods are in different namespace:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n1' },
});

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n2' },
});

const webPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'WebPolicy', {
  selector: web,
  // must be created in the 'web' namespace so it can select it.
  metadata: { namespace: web.metadata.namespace }
});
const redisPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'RedisPolicy', {
  selector: redis,
  // must be created in the 'redis' namespace so it can select it.
  metadata: { namespace: redis.metadata.namespace }
});

// allow the 'web' pod to initiate a connection to the 'redis' pod on port 6379
webPolicy.addEgressRule(redis, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]);

// allow the 'redis' pod to accept a connection from the 'web' pod on port 6379
redis.addIngressRule(web, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]);
`

If the source pod of your connection is a [managed pod](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#managed-pod)(or [managed workload](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#managed-workload)), the same thing can be achieved much easier:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n1' },
});

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n2' },
});

web.connections.allowTo(redis);
// or
redis.connections.allowFrom(web);
`

See [pod connections](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#connections) for more details.

## Default Policies[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#default-policies "Permanent link")

Every policy can specify what behavior should apply when no rules are specified in a given direction. You can use that to create default policies that either deny or allow all traffic.

### Deny All Ingress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#deny-all-ingress "Permanent link")

> See [default-deny-all-ingress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#default-deny-all-ingress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  ingress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.DENY },
});
`

This ensures that even pods that aren’t selected by any other network policy will still be isolated for ingress. This policy does not affect isolation for egress from any pod.

### Allow All Ingress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#allow-all-ingress "Permanent link")

> See [allow-all-ingress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#allow-all-ingress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  ingress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.ALLOW },
});
`

With this policy in place, no additional policy or policies can cause any incoming connection to those pods to be denied. This policy has no effect on isolation for egress from any pod.

Tip

This differs from the default `DENY` isolation behavior, which is effectively disabled when other policies are applied.

### Deny All Egress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#deny-all-egress "Permanent link")

> See [default-deny-all-egress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#default-deny-all-egress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  egress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.DENY },
});
`

This ensures that even pods that aren’t selected by any other NetworkPolicy will not be allowed egress traffic. This policy does not change the ingress isolation behavior of any pod.

### Allow All Egress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#allow-all-egress "Permanent link")

> See [allow-all-egress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#allow-all-egress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  egress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.ALLOW },
});
`

With this policy in place, no additional policy or policies can cause any outgoing connection from those pods to be denied. This policy has no effect on isolation for ingress to any pod.

Tip

This differs from the default `DENY` isolation behavior, which is effectively disabled when other policies are applied.

# Pod[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#pod "Permanent link")

A pod is essentially a collection of containers. It is the most fundamental computation unit that can be provisioned.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#pod)

## Create a `Pod`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#create-a-pod "Permanent link")

To create a new pod in the cluster:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod');
`

### Adding Containers[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#adding-containers "Permanent link")

Every `Pod` must have at least one container before you synthesize the application. You can add containers either during, or post instantiation:

`const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  containers: [{ image: 'image' }],
});

pod.addContainer({ image: 'another-image' });
`

### Adding Volumes[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#adding-volumes "Permanent link")

Volumes can be added to pod definition either during, or post instantiation:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const data1 = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir('data1');
const data2 = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir('data2');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  volumes: [data1],
});

pod.addVolume(data2);
`

Note that adding a volume to a pod doesn’t actually make the volume available to its containers. For that, you also need to mount the volume onto a container.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const data = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir('data');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod');
const container = pod.addContainer({ image: 'image' });

// mount the volume onto the container. this is actually enough, and you
// don't need to explicitly add the volume to the pod -- cdk8s+ will do that for you.
container.mount('/data', data);
`

### Applying a restart policy[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#applying-a-restart-policy "Permanent link")

A restart policy can only be specified at instantiation time:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  restartPolicy: kplus.RestartPolicy.NEVER,
});
`

### Assigning a ServiceAccount[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#assigning-a-serviceaccount "Permanent link")

A service account can only be specified at instantiation time:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  serviceAccount: kplus.ServiceAccount.fromServiceAccountName('aws'),
});
`

## Select pods[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#select-pods "Permanent link")

Pods can also be selected by various mechanisms. These selections are often used in other cdk8s+ API’s, such as [pod selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#pod-selection) during scheduling.

### Select pods with labels[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#select-pods-with-labels "Permanent link")

Selects all pods that have the `app=store` label.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const pods = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Store', { labels: { app: 'store' }});
`

### Select pods with expressions[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#select-pods-with-expressions "Permanent link")

Selects all pods that have the `app` label, regardless of the value.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const pods = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'App', {
  expressions: [kplus.LabelExpression.exists('app')]
});
`

### Select pods with labels in a particular namespace[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#select-pods-with-labels-in-a-particular-namespace "Permanent link")

Pod selection can also be scoped to specific namespaces. This is done using the `namespaces` property, which can accept any [namespace selector](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/namespace/#select-namespaces).

For example, select all pods that have the `app=store` label in the `backoffice` namespace:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const pods = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Pods', {
  labels: { app: 'store' },
  namespaces: kplus.Namespaces.select(this, 'Backoffice', { names: ['backoffice'] }),
});
`

## Scheduling[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#scheduling "Permanent link")

Kubernetes offers a few properties for controlling how pods are scheduled onto nodes.

* [nodeName](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodename)
* [nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
* [nodeAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity)
* [podAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity)
* [podAntiAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity)
* [tolearations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/)

CDK8s+ collapses all these different features and exposes them under one unified API we refer to as `Scheduling`. This API is available on a `Pod` via the `scheduling` property.

> The same API is also available on all workload resources (i.e `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, `DaemonSet`).

Scheduling is comprised of two different types:

* [Node Selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#node-selection)
* [Pod Selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#pod-selection)

### Node Selection[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#node-selection "Permanent link")

Node selection is the process of directly selecting which nodes should pods be scheduled on, by selecting node attributes.

#### Node Assignment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#node-assignment "Permanent link")

You can statically assign a pod to a specific node, by using the node’s name.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
redis.scheduling.assign(kplus.Node.named('node1'));
`

This example will cause the `Redis` pod to be scheduled on a node with name `node1`.

#### Node Attraction[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#node-attraction "Permanent link")

Pods can attract themselves to nodes. As opposed to an assignment, an attraction can be made to a **set** of nodes, specified by node labels. An attraction can be either required, or preferred.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
const highMemoryNodes = kplus.Node.labeled(kplus.NodeLabelQuery.is('memory', 'high'));
redis.scheduling.attract(highMemoryNodes);
`

This example will **require** the `Redis` pod be scheduled on a node that has the `memory=high` label. To request a **preference**, specify the [weight](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-weight) property:

`redis.scheduling.attract(highMemoryNodes, { weight: 50 });
`

#### Node Toleration[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#node-toleration "Permanent link")

While attractions is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes, taints are the opposite – they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

Tolerations are applied to pods, and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node; this marks that the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints.

A toleration can be made to a **set** of nodes, specified by node taints.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});

const node = kplus.Node.tainted(kplus.NodeTaintQuery.is('key1', 'value1', {
  effect: kplus.TainEffect.NO_SCHEDULE
}));
redis.scheduling.tolerate(node);
`

This example says the the `Redis` pod is able to tolerate nodes tainted with `key1=value1:NoSchedule`.

### Pod Selection[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#pod-selection "Permanent link")

Pod selection is the process of selecting which **nodes** should pods be scheduled on, by looking at which other **pods** are already scheduled on those nodes.

The API’s presented here interact either with specific pods, i.e instances of `Pod` or `Workload` (e.g `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, …), or with a group of pods, i.e ones that are identified by a set of [selectors](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#select-pods).

#### Pod Co-location[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#pod-co-location "Permanent link")

Pod co-location is a way to tell the scheduler to place a pod in a _topology_that already hosts other pods that meet some criteria.

A topology is expressed via the `topology` property, and represents a failure domain that Kubernetes is aware of. It can be one of:

* `kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME`: A single node. This is the default value.
* `kplus.Topology.ZONE`: Multiple nodes in a single availability zone.
* `kplus.Topology.REGION`: Multiple nodes in a single region.
* `kplus.Topology.custom`: Any other configurable value.

Similarly to node attractions, co-location can also be either required, or preferred.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

web.scheduling.colocate(redis);
`

This example will require the `Web` pod to be scheduled on the same node as the `Redis` pod. To request a **preference**, specify the [weight](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-weight) property:

`web.scheduling.colocate(redis, { weight: 50 });
`

To use a different topology, specify the `topology` property:

`web.scheduling.colocate(redis, { weight: 50, topology: kplus.Topology.ZONE });
`

This scenario configures co-location between two pods that are defined and managed in the same cdk8s application. You can also co-locate with an externally managed pod, by specifying a pod selector:

`const redis = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Cache', {
  labels: { app: 'cache' },
});
web.scheduling.colocate(redis);
`

This will co-locate the `Web` pod with pods that have the `app=cache` label, regardless of whether they are defined in the cdk8s app or not.

> **Under the hood**: Co-location with managed pods will automatically extract its labels and form the appropriate pod selector.

#### Pod Separation[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#pod-separation "Permanent link")

Pod separation (e.g anti co-location) is a way to tell the scheduler **not to** place a pod in a _topology_ that already hosts other pods that meet some criteria. Similarly to co-location, separation can also be either required, or preferred.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

web.scheduling.separate(redis);
`

This example will require the `Web` pod to **not be** scheduled on the same node (because the default value of the topology is `HOSTNAME`) as the `Redis` pod. To request a **preference**, specify the [weight](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-weight) property:

`web.scheduling.separate(redis, { weight: 50 });
`

To use a different topology, specify the `topology` property:

`web.scheduling.separate(redis, { weight: 50, topology: kplus.Topology.ZONE });
`

This scenario configures separation between two pods that are defined and managed in the same cdk8s application. You can also separate with an externally managed pod, by specifying a pod selector:

`const redis = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Cache', {
  labels: { app: 'cache' },
});
web.scheduling.separate(redis);
`

This will separate the `Web` pod from pods that have the `app=cache` label, regardless of whether they are defined in the cdk8s app or not.

> **Under the hood**: Co-location with managed pods will automatically extract its labels and form the appropriate pod selector.

## Connections[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#connections "Permanent link")

Pod connections offer a simplified API to automatically create [network policies](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/) on both ends of a connection. Accessing this API is done via the `connections` property of a specific `Pod`, which serves as one end of the connection. The other end is a network policy [peer](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#peers).

### Allow To[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#allow-to "Permanent link")

To allow connections from a `Pod` to a [peer](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#peers):

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

web.connections.allowTo(redis);
`

This will allow the `web` pod to connect to the `redis` port on port 6379, and will allow the `redis` pod to accept connections from the `web` pod on port 6379\. Note that the port is not specified in the `allowTo` invocation, it is automatically extracted from the `redis` pod definition.

You can also pass ports explicitly, overriding this extraction:

`web.connections.allowTo(redis, { ports: [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(4444)] });
`

### Allow From[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#allow-from "Permanent link")

To allow connections from a [peer](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/network-policy/#peers) to a `Pod`:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

redis.connections.allowFrom(web);
`

This will allow the `redis` pod to accept connection from the `web` pod on port 6379, and will allow the `web` pod to connect to the `redis` pod on port 6379\. Note that the port is not specified in the `allowFrom` invocation, it is automatically extracted from the `redis` pod definition.

### Isolation[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#isolation "Permanent link")

By default, the `allowXXX` methods will create both an egress policy on the initiating end, as well as an ingress policy on the accepting end of the connection.

This means that, if no other policies apply, both sides of the connection will be _isolated_, each in the corresponding direction. In the above [example](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pod/#allow-to), if the `redis` pod needs to be accessed from any pod other than `web`, an explicit policy needs to be applied, because the default _non-isolated_ behavior is now disabled.

To control the isolation this API incurs, you can use the `isolation` option. It accepts two possible values:

* `PodConnectionsIsolation.POD`: Only isolate the pod that offers the `connections` API.
* `PodConnectionsIsolation.PEER`: Only isolate the peer the pod needs to communicate with.

`// this will only create an egress policy on the 'web' pod.
web.connections.allowTo(redis, { isolation: PodConnectionsIsolation.POD });

// this will only create an ingress policy on the 'redis' pod.
web.connections.allowTo(redis, { isolation: PodConnectionsIsolation.PEER });

# PersistentVolume[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pv/#persistentvolume "Permanent link")

A `PersistentVolume` (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#persistent-volume)

PV’s are used by pods via the pod’s `volumes` spec, just like regular [volumes](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/volume/). They are not intended to be interchangable with volumes, you can think of a `PersistentVolume`as a specific type of volume, that is detached from a pod’s lifecycle, and exist even if the pod is shutdown.

The `PersistentVolume` construct represents a pre-existing volume in the cluster.

## Types[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pv/#types "Permanent link")

Each type is implmented as its own construct, exposing both common properties as well as type specific ones. Currently the supported types are:

* `AwsElasticBlockStorePersistentVolume`
* `AzureDiskPersistentVolume`
* `GCEPersistentDiskPersistentVolume`

For example, to create a PV from an existing AWS EBS volume:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';

const vol = new kplus.AwsElasticBlockStorePersistentVolume(chart, 'Volume', {
  // must exist in aws
  volumeId: 'vol1234',

  // assign the volume to small-ebs storage class
  storageClassName: 'small-ebs',

  // what is the volume storage
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
});
`

Note that this **does not** actually create a new volume, it merely manifests an existing volume in AWS as a Kubernetes resource.

## Reserve[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pv/#reserve "Permanent link")

> See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reserving-a-persistentvolume

Once the PV is defined, you can reserve it:

`const claim = vol.reserve();
`

This method creates a new `PersistentVolumeClaim` and performs a bi-directional binding that reserves the volume for usage. You can use the claim to mount a volume onto a container like usual:

`container.mount('/data', kplus.Volume.fromPersistentVolumeClaim(claim));
`

You can also directly mount a persistent volume, which will implicitly reserve it and create a volume from the created claim:

`const vol = new kplus.AwsElasticBlockStorePersistentVolume(chart, 'Volume', { volumeId: 'vol1234' });
container.mount('/data', vol);
`

## Bind[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pv/#bind "Permanent link")

Binding is a part of the reservation process, but it only creates a one directional link. You can use it to bind a PV to an existing PVC. Note however that if the PVC is not bound to the PV, there’s no guarantee this volume will indeed be given that specific claim.

`const claim = kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim.fromClaimName('claim');

// will modify the vol resource to refer to the claim.
// but no the other way around.
vol.bind(claim);
`

# PersistentVolumeClaim[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pvc/#persistentvolumeclaim "Permanent link")

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) is a request for storage by a pod.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#persistent-volume-claim)

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` contains the requirements of the request, and the Kubernetes control plane is responsible providing a physical volume that satisfies the claim’s requirements.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod');
const container = pod.addContainer({ image: 'node' });

// create the storage request
const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
});

// mount a volume based on the request to the container
// this will also add the volume itself to the pod spec.
container.mount('/data', kplus.Volume.fromPersistentVolumeClaim(claim));
`

## Storage Class[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pvc/#storage-class "Permanent link")

By default, the `storageClassName` property of a claim is not set. This means that the backing volume can be provided by one of two methods:

1. Dynamically provision a volume with the default storage class.
2. If a default storage class is not configured in the cluster, the backing volume must pre-exist and not be assigned to any storage class.

> See [Provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#provisioning) for more details.

You can also provide an explicit storage class name,

`const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
  storageClassName: 'large-ebs',
});
`

In this case, Kubernetes control plane will either locate an existing volume with the `larg-ebs` storage class, or dynamically provision a new using the appropriate provisioner.

You can also pass in a special `""` value, this means the volume must not be assigned to any storage class. Since all dynamically provisioend volumes belong to a storage class, setting this value effectively disables dynamic provisioning for this claim.

`const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
  // disable dynamic provisioning
  storageClassName: "",
});
`

## Bind[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/pvc/#bind "Permanent link")

Binding is a part of the reservation process, but it only creates a one directional link. You can use it to bind a PVC to an existing PV. Note however that if the PV is not bound to the PVC, there’s no guarantee this claim will indeed be given to that specific volume.

`const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
});

const vol = kplus.PersistentVolume.fromPersistentVolumeName('vol');

// will modify the claim resource to refer to the volume.
// but no the other way around.
claim.bind(vol);

# Role Based Access Control[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/rbac/#role-based-access-control "Permanent link")

Role Based Access Control(RBAC) helps you restrict actions that can be performed on specific Kubernetes resources. To make this possible, RBAC lets you create roles with rules which define access permissions for your specified resource.

These roles can then be binded to Kubernetes subjects, which could be User, Group or ServiceAccount.

Note

Rules or permissions are purely additive and there are no deny rules.

Now, there are two types of roles available, \* Role: These set permissions within a particular namespace i.e. is for namespaced resources, like, pods, deployments. \* ClusterRole: These set permissions for non-namespaced resources, like, nodes, urls.

and, similarly there are two types of binding available, \* RoleBinding: These grant permissions within a specific namespace. \* ClusterRoleBinding: These grant cluster wide permissions .

## Role[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/rbac/#role "Permanent link")

### Create role and add rules to it[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/rbac/#create-role-and-add-rules-to-it "Permanent link")

`` import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Creating RBAC Role
    const role = new kplus.Role(this, 'SampleRole');

    // The convenience method here `allowReadWrite` would add
    // `get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete,
    // deletecollection` rules to the role for deployment resources.
    role.allowReadWrite(kplus.ApiResource.DEPLOYMENTS);

    const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
    const group = kplus.Group.fromName(this, 'SampleGroup', 'sample-group');
    const serviceAccount = new kplus.ServiceAccount(this, 'SampleServiceAccount');

    // You can bind this role to a specific user, group or service account
    role.bind(user, group, serviceAccount);
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'rbac-docs');
app.synth();
 ``

## ClusterRole[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/rbac/#clusterrole "Permanent link")

### Create ClusterRole and add rules to it[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/rbac/#create-clusterrole-and-add-rules-to-it "Permanent link")

`// Creating RBAC ClusterRole
const clusterRole = new kplus.ClusterRole(this, 'SampleClusterRole');

// Adding list of rules to the ClusterRole for 'Nodes' and 'URL' non-namespaced resource
clusterRole.allowReadWrite(kplus.ApiResource.NODES, kplus.NonApiResource.of('/healthz'));

const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
const group = kplus.Group.fromName(this, 'SampleGroup', 'sample-group');
const serviceAccount = new kplus.ServiceAccount(this, 'SampleServiceAccount');

// You can bind this cluster role to a specific user, group or service account
clusterRole.bind(user, group, serviceAccount);
`

## Resource Permission Methods[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/rbac/#resource-permission-methods "Permanent link")

You can use convenience methods like `grantRead` and `grantReadWrite` which would make it easier to grant list of subjects set of permissions for the resource.

### `grantReadWrite` Method[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/rbac/#grantreadwrite-method "Permanent link")

`// Creating a Pod resource
const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod', {
    containers: [{ image: 'image' }],
});

const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
const group = kplus.Group.fromName(this, 'SampleGroup', 'sample-group');
const serviceAccount = new kplus.ServiceAccount(this, 'SampleServiceAccount');

// You can grant permissions to specific user, group or service account.
pod.permissions.grantReadWrite(user, group, serviceAccount);
`

## Add subjects to an already bound role[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/rbac/#add-subjects-to-an-already-bound-role "Permanent link")

`const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
const binding = role.bind(user);

const anotherUser = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'AnotherSampleUser', 'James');
binding.addSubjects(anotherUser);

# Secret[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/secret/#secret "Permanent link")

Secrets are used to store confidential information. Never store such information on the definition of the pod itself.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#secret)

## Use an existing `Secret`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/secret/#use-an-existing-secret "Permanent link")

To reference a secret created outside of your deployment definition, use the following. Note that this does not create a new object, and will therefore not be included in the resulting manifest.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const secret = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName('aws-creds');
`

## Adding data[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/secret/#adding-data "Permanent link")

To create a new secret with some data, use:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const secret = new kplus.Secret(chart, 'Secret');
secret.addStringData('password', 'some-encrypted-data');

# ServiceAccount[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/service-account/#serviceaccount "Permanent link")

Use service accounts to provide an identity for pods.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#serviceaccount)

## Use an existing `ServiceAccount`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/service-account/#use-an-existing-serviceaccount "Permanent link")

To reference a service account created outside of your deployment definition, use the following. Note that this does not create a new object, and will therefore not be included in the resulting manifest.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const serviceAccount = kplus.ServiceAccount.fromServiceAccountName('aws-service');
`

## Allowing access to secrets[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/service-account/#allowing-access-to-secrets "Permanent link")

To create a new service account, and give it access to some secrets, use the following:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const awsCreds = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName('aws-creds');
const awsService = new kplus.ServiceAccount(chart, 'AWS');

// give access to the aws creds secret.
awsService.addSecret(awsCreds);
`

# Service[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/service/#service "Permanent link")

Use services when you want to expose a set of pods using a stable network identity. They can also be used for externalizing endpoints to clients outside of the kubernetes cluster.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#service)

## Selectors[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/service/#selectors "Permanent link")

Services must be configured with selectors that tell it which pods should it serve. The most common selector method is using labels.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');
const frontends = new kplus.Service(chart, 'FrontEnds');

// this will cause the service to select all pods with the 'run: frontend' label.
frontends.select(kplus.LabelSelector.equals('run', 'frontend'));
`

## Ports[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/service/#ports "Permanent link")

Ports that the service will listen and redirect to can be configured like so:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');
const frontends = new kplus.Service(chart, 'FrontEnds');

// make the service bind to port 9000 and redirect to port 80 on the associated containers.
frontends.bind({port: 9000, targetPort: 80)

# Volume[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/volume/#volume "Permanent link")

Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#volume)

## Create from a ConfigMap[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/volume/#create-from-a-configmap "Permanent link")

A very useful operation is to create a volume from a `ConfigMap`. Kubernetes will translate every key in the config map to a file, who’s content is the value of the key.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const configMap = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName('redis-config');
const configVolume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(configMap);
`

## Create from an EmptyDir[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-29/volume/#create-from-an-emptydir "Permanent link")

The easiest way to allocate some persistent storage to your container is to create a volume from an empty directory. This volume, as the name suggests, is initially empty, and can be written to by containers who mount it. The data in the volume is preserved throughout the lifecycle of the pod, but is deleted forever as soon as the pod itself is removed.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-29';

const data = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir(configMap);

const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
const redis = pod.addContainer({
  image: 'redis'
})

// mount to the redis container.
redis.mount('/var/lib/redis', data);

# ConfigMap[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/config-map/#configmap "Permanent link")

ConfigMap are used to store configuration data. They provide a dictionary based data structure that can be consumed in various shapes and forms.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#configmap)

## Use an existing `ConfigMap`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/config-map/#use-an-existing-configmap "Permanent link")

You can reference to an existing `ConfigMap` like so. Note that this does not create a new object, and will therefore not be included in the resulting manifest.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: ChartProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const config: kplus.IConfigMap = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName(this, 'ConfigMap', 'config');

    // the 'config' constant can later be used by API's that require an IConfigMap.
    // for example when creating a volume.
    kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(this, 'Volume', config);
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'VolumeFromConfigMap');
app.synth();
`

## Adding data[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/config-map/#adding-data "Permanent link")

You can create config maps and add some data to them like so:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: ChartProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const config = new kplus.ConfigMap(this, 'Config');
    config.addData('url', 'https://my-endpoint:8080');
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'ConfigMap');
app.synth();
`

## Creating a volume from a directory[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/config-map/#creating-a-volume-from-a-directory "Permanent link")

Here is a nifty little trick you can use to create a volume that contains a directory on the client machine (machine that runs `cdk8s synth`):

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import * as path from 'path';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: ChartProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    const appMap = new kplus.ConfigMap(this, 'Config');

    // add the files in the directory to the config map.
    // this will create a key for each file.
    // note: this directory needs to exist
    // note: that only top level files will be included, sub-directories are not yet supported.
    appMap.addDirectory(path.join(__dirname, 'app'));

    const appVolume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(this, 'ConfigMap', appMap);

    const mountPath = '/var/app';
    const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
    const container = pod.addContainer({
      image: 'node',
      command: [ 'node', 'app.js' ],
      workingDir: mountPath,
    });

    // from here, just mount the volume to a container, and run your app!
    container.mount(mountPath, appVolume);
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'AppWithDir');
app.synth();

# Container[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/container/#container "Permanent link")

Define containers that run in a pod using the `Container` class.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#container)

## Environment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/container/#environment "Permanent link")

A container’s environment can be populated by various methods.

### Variables[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/container/#variables "Permanent link")

Environment variables can be added to containers by specifying the variable name and value. The value can come from different sources, either dynamic or static.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
    const container = pod.addContainer({
      image: 'my-app'
    });

    // use a static value.
    container.env.addVariable('endpoint', kplus.EnvValue.fromValue('value'));

    // use a specific key from a config map.
    const backendsConfig = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName(this, 'BackendConfig', 'backends');
    container.env.addVariable('endpoint', kplus.EnvValue.fromConfigMap(backendsConfig, 'endpoint'));

    // use a specific key from a secret.
    const credentials = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName(this, 'Credentials', 'credentials');
    container.env.addVariable('password', kplus.EnvValue.fromSecretValue({ secret: credentials, key: 'password' }));
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'container');
app.synth();
`

### Sources[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/container/#sources "Permanent link")

Environment variables can also be populated by referencing other objects as an environment source. With this method, all the key-value data of the source is added as environment variables, where the key is the env name and the value is the env value.

`const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
const cm = new kplus.ConfigMap(this, 'ConfigMap', {
  data: {
    key: 'value',
  }
});
const container = pod.addContainer({
  image: 'my-app'
});

// this will add 'key=value' env variable at runtime.
container.env.copyFrom(kplus.Env.fromConfigMap(cm));
`

## Volume Mounts[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/container/#volume-mounts "Permanent link")

A very common capability is to mount a volume with some data onto a container. Using pure kubernetes API, this would require writing something like:

`kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: main
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /path/to/mount
          name: 'config-volume'
  volumes:
    - name: 'config-volume'
      configMap:
        name: 'config'
`

Notice the apparent redundancy of having to specify the volume name twice. Also, if you happen to need the same mount in other pods, you would need to duplicate this configuration. This can get complex and cluttered very fast.

In contrast, here is how to do this with `cdk8s+`:

`const config = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName(this, 'Config', 'config');
const volume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(this, 'Volume', config);

const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
const container = pod.addContainer({
  image: 'my-app'
})

// Cool alert: every pod that will later be configured with this container,
// will automatically have access to this volume, so you don't need to explicitly add it to the pod spec!.
container.mount('/path/to/mount', volume);
`

## Probes[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/container/#probes "Permanent link")

A [Probe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#probe-v1-core) is a diagnostic performed periodically by the kubelet on a Container. To perform a diagnostic, the kubelet calls a Handler implemented by the container.

A `Probe` instance can be created through one of the `fromXxx` static methods:

* `Probe.fromHttpGet()`
* `Probe.fromCommand()`

Readiness, liveness, and startup probes can be configured at the container-level through the `readiness`, `liveness`, and `startup` options:

`new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod', {
  containers: [
    {
      image: 'my-app',
      readiness: kplus.Probe.fromHttpGet('/ping'),
    }
  ]
});
`

See the API reference for details.

# CronJob[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/cronjob/#cronjob "Permanent link")

CronJob resource is responsible for creating recurring [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/). The job recurrence is determined by a [Cron](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/blob/2.x/src/cron.ts) expression.

CronJob is similar to a [job](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/job/) but it is suitable when there is a need to run a job indefinitely following a schedule. These repetitive jobs can be utilized for recurring tasks such as backing up a database, pinging a server for health checks, creating snapshots of systems and much more.

## Creating a `CronJob`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/cronjob/#creating-a-cronjob "Permanent link")

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps, Cron } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new kplus.CronJob(this, 'CronJob', {
      containers: [{
        image: 'databack/mysql-backup',
      }],
      // You can pass a custom cron schedule using our Cron class
      schedule: Cron.schedule({
        minute: '*',
        hour: '*',
        day: '*',
        month: '*',
        weekDay: '*',
      }),
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'cronjob-readme');
app.synth();
`

### Defaults[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/cronjob/#defaults "Permanent link")

The above would create a cronjob resource which would schedule `databack/mysql-backup` to run every minute. With this resource, we also set some meaningful defaults. For instance, this cronjob would not run jobs concurrently by default. It will also retain 3 instance of successful job runs and 1 instance of a failed run for debugging later if needed. To customize the properties, see [API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#cronjob).

### Helper Functions[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/cronjob/#helper-functions "Permanent link")

As we see in the previous example, we can pass custom cron expression for scheduling our jobs. But, we have also have added helper functions that would make it easy to mention some of the commonly used schedules. These include scheduling jobs to run every minute, hour, day, week, month or year. For instance, the same example mentioned before could be written as,

`new kplus.CronJob(this, 'CronJob', {
  containers: [{
    image: 'databack/mysql-backup',
  }],
  // This would schedule jobs to be scheduled to run every minute
  schedule: Cron.everyMinute(),
});
`

### Validations[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/cronjob/#validations "Permanent link")

The cronjob construct also validates some of the properties so that the manifest created works as expected.

* You cannot pass `startingDeadline` property value less that 10 seconds. This is because the Kubernetes CronJobController checks things every 10 seconds and if the value passed is less than that then the jobs would not be scheduled.
* `ttlAfterFinished` job property limits the lifetime of a job that has finished execution. You cannot pass the `ttlAfterFinished` property with any/both of the `successfulJobsRetained` and `failedJobsRetained` property since this would not let retention of jobs work in an expected manner.

# Deployment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/deployment/#deployment "Permanent link")

Create a deployment to govern the lifecycle and orchestration of a set of identical pods.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#deployment)

## Automatic pod selection[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/deployment/#automatic-pod-selection "Permanent link")

When you specify pods in a deployment, you normally have to configure the appropriate labels and selectors to make the deployment control the relevant pods. This construct does this automatically.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new kplus.Deployment(this, 'FrontEnds', {
      containers: [ { image: 'node' } ],
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'deployment');
app.synth();
`

Note the resulting manifest contains a special `cdk8s.io/metadata.addr` label that is applied to the pods, and is used as the selector for the deployment.

`apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-frontends-c8e48310
spec:
  minReadySeconds: 0
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 600
  replicas: 2

      containers:
        - image: node
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          name: main
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: 1500m
              memory: 2048Mi
            requests:
              cpu: 1000m
              memory: 512Mi
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            privileged: false
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
            runAsGroup: 26000
            runAsNonRoot: true
            runAsUser: 25000
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      securityContext:
        fsGroupChangePolicy: Always
        runAsNonRoot: true
      setHostnameAsFQDN: false
`

## Exposing via a service[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/deployment/#exposing-via-a-service "Permanent link")

Following up on pod selection, you can also easily create a service that will select the pods relevant to the deployment.

`// store the deployment to created in a constant
const frontends = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'FrontEnds', {
  containers: [ {
    image: 'node',
    portNumber: 9000,
  } ],
});

// create a ClusterIP service that listens on port 9000 and redirects to port 9000 on the containers.
frontends.exposeViaService({ ports: [{
  port: 9000,
}]
});
`

Notice the resulting manifest, will have the same `cdk8s.io/metadata.addr` magic label as the selector. This will cause the service to attach to the pods that were configured as part of the said deployment.

`apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

## Scheduling[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/deployment/#scheduling "Permanent link")

In addition to the scheduling capabilities provided by [pod scheduling](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#scheduling), a Deployment offers the following:

### Spreading[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/deployment/#spreading "Permanent link")

A spread is a [separation](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#pod-separation) of pods from themselves. It can be used to ensure replicas of the same workload are scheduled on different topologies.

> The same API is also available on all workload resources (i.e `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, `DaemonSet`).

`const redis = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }],
  replicas: 3,
});

redis.scheduling.spread({
  topology: kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME
});
`

This example ensures that each replica of the `Redis` deployment will be scheduled on a different node.

Take, for [example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#more-practical-use-cases), a three-node cluster running a web application with an in-memory cache like redis. You’d like to co-locate the web servers with the cache as much as possible, while still maintaining node failure resistance. (i.e not all pods are on the same node).

Here is how you can accomplish that:

`const redis = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }],
  replicas: 3,
});

const web = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
  replicas: 3,
});

// ensure redis is spread across all nodes
redis.scheduling.spread({
  topology: kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME
});

// ensure web app is spread across all nodes
web.scheduling.spread({
  topology: kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME
});

// ensure a web app pod always runs along side a cache instance
web.scheduling.colocate(redis);
`

# HorizontalPodAutoscaler[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#horizontalpodautoscaler "Permanent link")

HorizontalPodAutoscaler allows your services to scale up when demand is high and scale down when they are no longer needed.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#horizontalpodautoscaler)

## Using a HorizontalPodAutoscaler[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#using-a-horizontalpodautoscaler "Permanent link")

The example below creates a HorizontalPodAutoscaler that scales the number of replicas of a Deployment based on the average CPU utilization of the pods.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

// Lets create a deployment for our web server
const bookstoreWebsite = new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'BookstoreWebsite', {
  containers: [ { image: 'node' } ],
});

// Now define a HorizontalPodAutoscaler
const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.resourceCpu(kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(70)),
  ],
 });
// This will scale our website deployment up when the average CPU utilization
// is 70% or higher up to a maximum of 10 replicas.
`

Using the example above, if our web server passes 70% CPU utilization the autoscaler will try and figure out the number of replicas to scale.

The autoscaler uses the following formula:

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[currentReplicas \* ( currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue )\]

Based on this formula we can find out how many replicas will be scaled. For example if we have 1 replica and the CPU utilization is at 70%.

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[1 \* ( 70 / 70 )\] = 1

The autoscaler will try and add 1 replica, meaning we’ll have 2 web servers running, the original and the new replica.

If the CPU utilization is 140% the autoscaler will try and provision 2 replicas. Scaling us up to 3 web servers total.

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[1 \* ( 140 / 70 )\] = 2

This works the same way when scaling down.

For example if our target CPU utilization is 70% and we have 3 replicas running and the CPU utilization is at 50%.

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[3 \* ( 50 / 70 )\] = 2

The autoscaler will try and remove 1 replica, meaning we’ll have 2 web servers running, the original and the new replica.

## Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#metrics "Permanent link")

The HorizontalPodAutoscaler supports the following metrics:

### Resource Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#resource-metrics "Permanent link")

Resource metrics are used to scale on a resource like CPU or memory.

Since the resource usages of all the containers are summed up the total pod utilization may not accurately represent the individual container resource usage. This could lead to situations where a single container might be running with high usage and the HPA will not scale out because the overall pod usage is still within acceptable limits.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.resourceCpu(kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(70)),
  ],
 });
`

### Pods Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#pods-metrics "Permanent link")

Pods metrics are used to scale on a metric describing each pod in the current scale target (for example, transactions-processed-per-second).

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.pods({
      name: 'requests-per-second',
      target: kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(50),
      labelSelector: kplus.LabelSelector.of({ labels: { app: 'scraper' } }),
    }),
  ],
 });
`

## Container Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#container-metrics "Permanent link")

Container metrics are used to scale on one of the scaling target’s container metrics.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.containerMemory(kplus.MetricTarget.value(4096)),
  ],
 });
`

### Object Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#object-metrics "Permanent link")

Object metrics are used to scale on a metric describing a single kubernetes object (for example, requests-per-second on an Ingress object).

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.object({
        object: ingress,
        name: 'requests-per-second',
        target: kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(50),
      }),
  ],
});
`

### External Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#external-metrics "Permanent link")

External metrics are used to scale on a metric not associated with any Kubernetes object (for example, an SQS queue).

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
    kplus.Metric.external({
      labelSelector: kplus.LabelSelector.of({ labels: { app: 'scraper' } }),
      name: 'sqs-queue',
      target: kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(50),
    }),
  ],
 });

## Scaling behavior[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#scaling-behavior "Permanent link")

The HorizontalPodAutoscaler has a few options to control the scaling behavior.

### scaleUp /scaleDown[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#scaleup-scaledown "Permanent link")

The `scaleUp` / `scaleDown` options controls how fast the HorizontalPodAutoscaler scales up and down. They share the same options but have slightly different defaults.

`const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  scaleUp: {
    stabilizationWindow: 60,
    policies: [
      kplus.PolicyType.pods(4),
      kplus.PolicyType.percent(200),
    ],
  },
  scaleDown: {
    stabilizationWindow: 60,
    policies: [
      kplus.PolicyType.pods(2),
      kplus.PolicyType.percent(100),
    ],
  },
 });
`

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                     | scaleUp Default                                                                            | scaleDown Default                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stabilizationWindow | Defines the window of past metrics that the autoscaler should consider when calculating wether or not autoscaling should occur. | 5 minutes                                                                                  | 0 (no stabilization is performed)                                                         |
| strategy            | Determines if the the Autoscaler should scale as much or as little as possible.                                                 | ScalingStrategy.MAX\_CHANGE Choose the scaling policy that will scale the most replicas.   | ScalingStrategy.MIN\_CHANGE Choose the scaling policy that will scale the least replicas. |
| policies            | Defines how many replicas are scaled. Can be an absolute number or a percentage of the current replica count.                   | \* Increase no more than 4 pods per 60 seconds \* Double the number of pods per 60 seconds | \* Decrease to minReplica count (default 1)                                               |

Check out the example below. We have a `scaleUp` policy that will scale up by 4 pods or double the current number of pods per 60 seconds. Because the `strategy` has been configured to `ScalingStrategy.MAX_CHANGE` the autoscaler will choose the policy that will make the most replicas.

`const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.resourceCpu(kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(70)),
  ],
  scaleUp: {
    strategy: kplus.ScalingStrategy.MAX_CHANGE,
    stabilizationWindow: 60,
    policies: [
      kplus.PolicyType.pods(4),
      kplus.PolicyType.percent(200),
    ],
  },
 });
`

This means that if we currently have 3 web server pods, and the CPU utilization is at 72% the autoscaler will try and add 6 pods every 60 seconds.

This will result in a total of 9 web server pods. If after 60 seconds the CPU utilization is still at 72% the autoscaler will only be allowed to add one more replica because `maxReplicas` has been configured to 10.

# Ingress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/ingress/#ingress "Permanent link")

[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) manages external access to services in a cluster, typically through HTTP. Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#ingressv1beta1)

You must have an [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers) to satisfy an Ingress. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect.

The following example will route HTTP requests sent to the `/hello` url prefix to a service associated with a deployment of the[hashicorp/http-echo](https://github.com/hashicorp/http-echo) image.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const helloDeployment = new kplus.Deployment(this, "Deployment", {
      containers: [
        {
          image: 'hashicorp/http-echo',
          args: [ '-text', 'hello ingress' ],
          portNumber: 5678,
        }
      ]
    });

    const helloService = helloDeployment.exposeViaService({
        ports: [
          {
            port: 5678,
          }
        ]
      });

    const ingress = new kplus.Ingress(this, 'ingress');
    ingress.addRule('/hello', kplus.IngressBackend.fromService(helloService));
 }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'ingress');
app.synth();
`

You can use `addHostRule(host, path, backend)` to define a route that will only apply to requests with this `Host` header. This can be used to implement virtual hosts.

The `addDefaultBackend(backend)` and `addHostDefaultBackend(host, backend)`methods can be used to define backends that will accept all requests that do not match any other rules.

The TCP port used to route requests to services will be determined based on which ports are exposed by the service (e.g. through `serve()`). If the service exposes multiple ports, then a port must be specified via`IngressBackend.fromService(service, { port })`.

# Job[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/job/#job "Permanent link")

Jobs are a very useful concept in kubernetes deployments. They can be used for add-hoc provisioning tasks, as well as long running processing jobs.

In configuration, they don’t differ much from regular pods, but offer some additional properties.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#job)

## Delete a Job after its finished[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/job/#delete-a-job-after-its-finished "Permanent link")

You can configure a TTL for the job after it finished its execution successfully.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps, Duration } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // let's define a job spec, and set a 1 second TTL.
    const job = new kplus.Job(this, 'LoadData', {
      ttlAfterFinished: Duration.seconds(1)
    });

    // now add a container to all the pods created by this job
    job.addContainer({
      image: 'loader'
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'Job');
app.synth();
`

## Scheduling[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/job/#scheduling "Permanent link")

See [Deployment scheduling](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/deployment/#scheduling).

## Connections[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/job/#connections "Permanent link")

# Namespace[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/namespace/#namespace "Permanent link")

Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#namespace)

## Create a `Namespace`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/namespace/#create-a-namespace "Permanent link")

To create a new namespace in the cluster:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const namespace = new kplus.Namespace(chart, 'BackOfficeNamespace');
`

Like any other resource, if you don’t specify a name, cdk8s will auto-generate one, which you can access by `namespace.name`.

## Select namespaces[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/namespace/#select-namespaces "Permanent link")

Namespaces can also be selected by various mechanisms. These selections are often used in other cdk8s+ API’s, such as [pod selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#pod-selection) during scheduling.

### Select namespaces by name[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/namespace/#select-namespaces-by-name "Permanent link")

Select a namespace called `backoffice`.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const backoffice = kplus.Namespaces.select(this, 'Backoffice', { names: ['backoffice'] });
`

### Select namespace by labels[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/namespace/#select-namespace-by-labels "Permanent link")

Select all namespaces that have the `processing=batch` label.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const batch = kplus.Namespaces.select(this, 'Batch', { labels: { processing: 'batch'} });
`

### Select all namespaces[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/namespace/#select-all-namespaces "Permanent link")

Select all namespaces in the cluster.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const all = kplus.Namespaces.all();

# Network Policy[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#network-policy "Permanent link")

Network policies control inter-pod traffic flow at the IP address or port level (OSI layer 3 or 4). By default, a pod is opened in the network (or _non-isolated_). That is, it can initiate any outgoing traffic, and accept any incoming traffic.

When network policies are applied to pods, they lose this default behavior and become restricted, or _isolated_. This means that as soon as a policy in a specific direction applies to a pod, that pod stops being open in that direction. We refer to such pods as **isolated**. There are two sorts of isolation for a pod: isolation for egress, and isolation for ingress.

Network policies do not conflict; they are additive. If any policy or policies apply to a given pod for a given direction, the connections allowed in that direction from that pod is the union of what the applicable policies allow. Thus, order of evaluation does not affect the policy result.

For a connection from a source pod to a destination pod to be allowed, both the egress policy on the source pod and the ingress policy on the destination pod need to allow the connection. If either side does not allow the connection, it will not happen.

## Create a `NetworkPolicy`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#create-a-networkpolicy "Permanent link")

A network policy is a namespaced resource that applies to specific pods in that namespace. The pods are specified using the `selector` property, and can accept a few different objects:

### Managed Pod[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#managed-pod "Permanent link")

A managed pod is a pod that is created by the current cdk8s application. That is, its simply an instance of a `Pod`. You can pass that instance to be used as the selector. The policy will be applied only to that **specific** pod.

> Under the hood, this uses a magic `cdk8s.io/metadata.address` label that uniquely identifies pods, and is added automatically by cdk8s.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', { selector: web });
`

### Managed Workload[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#managed-workload "Permanent link")

Exactly as for a managed `Pod`, you can pass an instance of any workload resource (e.g `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, …)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', { selector: web });
`

### Selected Pods[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#selected-pods "Permanent link")

If you’d like to create a policy for pods that aren’t managed by the current cdk8s application, you use [selected pods](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#select-pods).

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = kplus.Pods.select(chart, 'Web', { labels: { app: 'web' }});

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', { selector: web });
`

This policy will apply to **all** pods with label `app=web`.

## Ip Block[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#ip-block "Permanent link")

An Ip Block defines a range of IP addresses using CIDR notation. You can define both `ipv4` and `ipv6` ranges:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

// define a specific ipv4 range
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.ipv4('172.17.0.0/16');

// define a specific ipv6 range
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.ipv6('2002::1234:abcd:ffff:c0a8:101/64');

// define all ipv4 addresses
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.anyIpv4();

// define all ipv6 addresses
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.anyIpv6();
`

Ip blocks can later be used as network policy [peers](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#peers).

## Peers[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#peers "Permanent link")

The selector of a policy is defined at construction time and there can only be one per policy. The peers constitute the second half of the connection – they are the resources or endpoints that the **selected** resources can communicate with. A policy can define rules for multiple peers, and a peer can be any one of:

* [Ip Block](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#ip-block): Will allow a connection with a CIDR range.
* [Managed Pod](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#managed-pod): Will establish a connection with specific pod.
* [Managed Workload](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#managed-workload): Will establish a connection with the pods of the workload.
* [Selected Pods](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#selected-pods): Will establish a connection with the selected pods.
* [Managed Namespace](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/namespace/): Will establish a connection with all pods in a specific namespace.
* [Selected Namespaces](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/namespace/#select-namespaces): Will establish a connection with all pods in the selected namespaces.

> You can also create a custom peer by implementing the `kplus.INetworkPolicyPeer` interface.

## Egress Rule[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#egress-rule "Permanent link")

Isolating pods for egress traffic egress can be done either at, or post construction:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

const cache = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Cache', {
  containers: [{ image: 'cache', portNumber: 6379 }],
});

const db = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'DB', {
  containers: [{ image: 'db', portNumber: 6378 }],
});

// create a policy with an egress rule at instantiation
const webPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  selector: web,
  egress: { rules: [{ peer: cache, ports: [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]}] },
});

// add an egress rule post instantiation
webPolicy.addEgressRule(db, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6378)]);
`

## Ingress Rule[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#ingress-rule "Permanent link")

Isolating pods for ingress traffic ingress can be done either at, or post construction:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

const cache = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Cache', {
  containers: [{ image: 'cache', portNumber: 6379 }],
});

const db = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'DB', {
  containers: [{ image: 'db', portNumber: 6378 }],
});

// create a policy with an ingress rule at instantiation
const dbPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  selector: db,
  ingress: { rule: [{ peer: web, ports: [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]}] },
});

// add an ingress rule post instantiation
redis.addIngressRule(cache, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]);
`

## Bi-directional Rule[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#bi-directional-rule "Permanent link")

As mentioned earlier, for a connection from a source pod to a destination pod to be allowed, both the egress policy on the source pod and the ingress policy on the destination pod need to allow the connection. Using network policies, this could be tricky, especially if the pods are in different namespace:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n1' },
});

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n2' },
});

const webPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'WebPolicy', {
  selector: web,
  // must be created in the 'web' namespace so it can select it.
  metadata: { namespace: web.metadata.namespace }
});
const redisPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'RedisPolicy', {
  selector: redis,
  // must be created in the 'redis' namespace so it can select it.
  metadata: { namespace: redis.metadata.namespace }
});

// allow the 'web' pod to initiate a connection to the 'redis' pod on port 6379
webPolicy.addEgressRule(redis, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]);

// allow the 'redis' pod to accept a connection from the 'web' pod on port 6379
redis.addIngressRule(web, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]);
`

If the source pod of your connection is a [managed pod](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#managed-pod)(or [managed workload](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#managed-workload)), the same thing can be achieved much easier:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n1' },
});

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n2' },
});

web.connections.allowTo(redis);
// or
redis.connections.allowFrom(web);
`

See [pod connections](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#connections) for more details.

## Default Policies[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#default-policies "Permanent link")

Every policy can specify what behavior should apply when no rules are specified in a given direction. You can use that to create default policies that either deny or allow all traffic.

### Deny All Ingress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#deny-all-ingress "Permanent link")

> See [default-deny-all-ingress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#default-deny-all-ingress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  ingress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.DENY },
});
`

This ensures that even pods that aren’t selected by any other network policy will still be isolated for ingress. This policy does not affect isolation for egress from any pod.

### Allow All Ingress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#allow-all-ingress "Permanent link")

> See [allow-all-ingress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#allow-all-ingress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  ingress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.ALLOW },
});
`

With this policy in place, no additional policy or policies can cause any incoming connection to those pods to be denied. This policy has no effect on isolation for egress from any pod.

Tip

This differs from the default `DENY` isolation behavior, which is effectively disabled when other policies are applied.

### Deny All Egress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#deny-all-egress "Permanent link")

> See [default-deny-all-egress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#default-deny-all-egress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  egress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.DENY },
});
`

This ensures that even pods that aren’t selected by any other NetworkPolicy will not be allowed egress traffic. This policy does not change the ingress isolation behavior of any pod.

### Allow All Egress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#allow-all-egress "Permanent link")

> See [allow-all-egress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#allow-all-egress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  egress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.ALLOW },
});
`

With this policy in place, no additional policy or policies can cause any outgoing connection from those pods to be denied. This policy has no effect on isolation for ingress to any pod.

Tip

This differs from the default `DENY` isolation behavior, which is effectively disabled when other policies are applied.

# Pod[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#pod "Permanent link")

A pod is essentially a collection of containers. It is the most fundamental computation unit that can be provisioned.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#pod)

## Create a `Pod`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#create-a-pod "Permanent link")

To create a new pod in the cluster:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod');
`

### Adding Containers[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#adding-containers "Permanent link")

Every `Pod` must have at least one container before you synthesize the application. You can add containers either during, or post instantiation:

`const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  containers: [{ image: 'image' }],
});

pod.addContainer({ image: 'another-image' });
`

### Adding Volumes[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#adding-volumes "Permanent link")

Volumes can be added to pod definition either during, or post instantiation:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const data1 = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir('data1');
const data2 = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir('data2');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  volumes: [data1],
});

pod.addVolume(data2);
`

Note that adding a volume to a pod doesn’t actually make the volume available to its containers. For that, you also need to mount the volume onto a container.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const data = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir('data');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod');
const container = pod.addContainer({ image: 'image' });

// mount the volume onto the container. this is actually enough, and you
// don't need to explicitly add the volume to the pod -- cdk8s+ will do that for you.
container.mount('/data', data);
`

### Applying a restart policy[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#applying-a-restart-policy "Permanent link")

A restart policy can only be specified at instantiation time:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  restartPolicy: kplus.RestartPolicy.NEVER,
});
`

### Assigning a ServiceAccount[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#assigning-a-serviceaccount "Permanent link")

A service account can only be specified at instantiation time:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  serviceAccount: kplus.ServiceAccount.fromServiceAccountName('aws'),
});
`

## Select pods[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#select-pods "Permanent link")

Pods can also be selected by various mechanisms. These selections are often used in other cdk8s+ API’s, such as [pod selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#pod-selection) during scheduling.

### Select pods with labels[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#select-pods-with-labels "Permanent link")

Selects all pods that have the `app=store` label.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const pods = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Store', { labels: { app: 'store' }});
`

### Select pods with expressions[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#select-pods-with-expressions "Permanent link")

Selects all pods that have the `app` label, regardless of the value.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const pods = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'App', {
  expressions: [kplus.LabelExpression.exists('app')]
});
`

### Select pods with labels in a particular namespace[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#select-pods-with-labels-in-a-particular-namespace "Permanent link")

Pod selection can also be scoped to specific namespaces. This is done using the `namespaces` property, which can accept any [namespace selector](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/namespace/#select-namespaces).

For example, select all pods that have the `app=store` label in the `backoffice` namespace:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const pods = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Pods', {
  labels: { app: 'store' },
  namespaces: kplus.Namespaces.select(this, 'Backoffice', { names: ['backoffice'] }),
});
`

## Scheduling[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#scheduling "Permanent link")

Kubernetes offers a few properties for controlling how pods are scheduled onto nodes.

* [nodeName](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodename)
* [nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
* [nodeAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity)
* [podAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity)
* [podAntiAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity)
* [tolearations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/)

CDK8s+ collapses all these different features and exposes them under one unified API we refer to as `Scheduling`. This API is available on a `Pod` via the `scheduling` property.

> The same API is also available on all workload resources (i.e `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, `DaemonSet`).

Scheduling is comprised of two different types:

* [Node Selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#node-selection)
* [Pod Selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#pod-selection)

### Node Selection[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#node-selection "Permanent link")

Node selection is the process of directly selecting which nodes should pods be scheduled on, by selecting node attributes.

#### Node Assignment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#node-assignment "Permanent link")

You can statically assign a pod to a specific node, by using the node’s name.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
redis.scheduling.assign(kplus.Node.named('node1'));
`

This example will cause the `Redis` pod to be scheduled on a node with name `node1`.

#### Node Attraction[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#node-attraction "Permanent link")

Pods can attract themselves to nodes. As opposed to an assignment, an attraction can be made to a **set** of nodes, specified by node labels. An attraction can be either required, or preferred.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
const highMemoryNodes = kplus.Node.labeled(kplus.NodeLabelQuery.is('memory', 'high'));
redis.scheduling.attract(highMemoryNodes);
`

This example will **require** the `Redis` pod be scheduled on a node that has the `memory=high` label. To request a **preference**, specify the [weight](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-weight) property:

`redis.scheduling.attract(highMemoryNodes, { weight: 50 });
`

#### Node Toleration[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#node-toleration "Permanent link")

While attractions is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes, taints are the opposite – they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

Tolerations are applied to pods, and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node; this marks that the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints.

A toleration can be made to a **set** of nodes, specified by node taints.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});

const node = kplus.Node.tainted(kplus.NodeTaintQuery.is('key1', 'value1', {
  effect: kplus.TainEffect.NO_SCHEDULE
}));
redis.scheduling.tolerate(node);
`

This example says the the `Redis` pod is able to tolerate nodes tainted with `key1=value1:NoSchedule`.

### Pod Selection[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#pod-selection "Permanent link")

Pod selection is the process of selecting which **nodes** should pods be scheduled on, by looking at which other **pods** are already scheduled on those nodes.

The API’s presented here interact either with specific pods, i.e instances of `Pod` or `Workload` (e.g `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, …), or with a group of pods, i.e ones that are identified by a set of [selectors](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#select-pods).

#### Pod Co-location[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#pod-co-location "Permanent link")

Pod co-location is a way to tell the scheduler to place a pod in a _topology_that already hosts other pods that meet some criteria.

A topology is expressed via the `topology` property, and represents a failure domain that Kubernetes is aware of. It can be one of:

* `kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME`: A single node. This is the default value.
* `kplus.Topology.ZONE`: Multiple nodes in a single availability zone.
* `kplus.Topology.REGION`: Multiple nodes in a single region.
* `kplus.Topology.custom`: Any other configurable value.

Similarly to node attractions, co-location can also be either required, or preferred.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

web.scheduling.colocate(redis);
`

This example will require the `Web` pod to be scheduled on the same node as the `Redis` pod. To request a **preference**, specify the [weight](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-weight) property:

`web.scheduling.colocate(redis, { weight: 50 });
`

To use a different topology, specify the `topology` property:

`web.scheduling.colocate(redis, { weight: 50, topology: kplus.Topology.ZONE });
`

This scenario configures co-location between two pods that are defined and managed in the same cdk8s application. You can also co-locate with an externally managed pod, by specifying a pod selector:

`const redis = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Cache', {
  labels: { app: 'cache' },
});
web.scheduling.colocate(redis);
`

This will co-locate the `Web` pod with pods that have the `app=cache` label, regardless of whether they are defined in the cdk8s app or not.

> **Under the hood**: Co-location with managed pods will automatically extract its labels and form the appropriate pod selector.

#### Pod Separation[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#pod-separation "Permanent link")

Pod separation (e.g anti co-location) is a way to tell the scheduler **not to** place a pod in a _topology_ that already hosts other pods that meet some criteria. Similarly to co-location, separation can also be either required, or preferred.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

web.scheduling.separate(redis);
`

This example will require the `Web` pod to **not be** scheduled on the same node (because the default value of the topology is `HOSTNAME`) as the `Redis` pod. To request a **preference**, specify the [weight](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-weight) property:

`web.scheduling.separate(redis, { weight: 50 });
`

To use a different topology, specify the `topology` property:

`web.scheduling.separate(redis, { weight: 50, topology: kplus.Topology.ZONE });
`

This scenario configures separation between two pods that are defined and managed in the same cdk8s application. You can also separate with an externally managed pod, by specifying a pod selector:

`const redis = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Cache', {
  labels: { app: 'cache' },
});
web.scheduling.separate(redis);
`

This will separate the `Web` pod from pods that have the `app=cache` label, regardless of whether they are defined in the cdk8s app or not.

> **Under the hood**: Co-location with managed pods will automatically extract its labels and form the appropriate pod selector.

## Connections[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#connections "Permanent link")

Pod connections offer a simplified API to automatically create [network policies](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/) on both ends of a connection. Accessing this API is done via the `connections` property of a specific `Pod`, which serves as one end of the connection. The other end is a network policy [peer](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#peers).

### Allow To[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#allow-to "Permanent link")

To allow connections from a `Pod` to a [peer](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#peers):

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

web.connections.allowTo(redis);
`

This will allow the `web` pod to connect to the `redis` port on port 6379, and will allow the `redis` pod to accept connections from the `web` pod on port 6379\. Note that the port is not specified in the `allowTo` invocation, it is automatically extracted from the `redis` pod definition.

You can also pass ports explicitly, overriding this extraction:

`web.connections.allowTo(redis, { ports: [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(4444)] });
`

### Allow From[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#allow-from "Permanent link")

To allow connections from a [peer](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/network-policy/#peers) to a `Pod`:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

redis.connections.allowFrom(web);
`

This will allow the `redis` pod to accept connection from the `web` pod on port 6379, and will allow the `web` pod to connect to the `redis` pod on port 6379\. Note that the port is not specified in the `allowFrom` invocation, it is automatically extracted from the `redis` pod definition.

### Isolation[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#isolation "Permanent link")

By default, the `allowXXX` methods will create both an egress policy on the initiating end, as well as an ingress policy on the accepting end of the connection.

This means that, if no other policies apply, both sides of the connection will be _isolated_, each in the corresponding direction. In the above [example](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pod/#allow-to), if the `redis` pod needs to be accessed from any pod other than `web`, an explicit policy needs to be applied, because the default _non-isolated_ behavior is now disabled.

To control the isolation this API incurs, you can use the `isolation` option. It accepts two possible values:

* `PodConnectionsIsolation.POD`: Only isolate the pod that offers the `connections` API.
* `PodConnectionsIsolation.PEER`: Only isolate the peer the pod needs to communicate with.

`// this will only create an egress policy on the 'web' pod.
web.connections.allowTo(redis, { isolation: PodConnectionsIsolation.POD });

// this will only create an ingress policy on the 'redis' pod.
web.connections.allowTo(redis, { isolation: PodConnectionsIsolation.PEER });

# PersistentVolume[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pv/#persistentvolume "Permanent link")

A `PersistentVolume` (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#persistent-volume)

PV’s are used by pods via the pod’s `volumes` spec, just like regular [volumes](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/volume/). They are not intended to be interchangable with volumes, you can think of a `PersistentVolume`as a specific type of volume, that is detached from a pod’s lifecycle, and exist even if the pod is shutdown.

The `PersistentVolume` construct represents a pre-existing volume in the cluster.

## Types[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pv/#types "Permanent link")

Each type is implmented as its own construct, exposing both common properties as well as type specific ones. Currently the supported types are:

* `AwsElasticBlockStorePersistentVolume`
* `AzureDiskPersistentVolume`
* `GCEPersistentDiskPersistentVolume`

For example, to create a PV from an existing AWS EBS volume:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';

const vol = new kplus.AwsElasticBlockStorePersistentVolume(chart, 'Volume', {
  // must exist in aws
  volumeId: 'vol1234',

  // assign the volume to small-ebs storage class
  storageClassName: 'small-ebs',

  // what is the volume storage
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
});
`

Note that this **does not** actually create a new volume, it merely manifests an existing volume in AWS as a Kubernetes resource.

## Reserve[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pv/#reserve "Permanent link")

> See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reserving-a-persistentvolume

Once the PV is defined, you can reserve it:

`const claim = vol.reserve();
`

This method creates a new `PersistentVolumeClaim` and performs a bi-directional binding that reserves the volume for usage. You can use the claim to mount a volume onto a container like usual:

`container.mount('/data', kplus.Volume.fromPersistentVolumeClaim(claim));
`

You can also directly mount a persistent volume, which will implicitly reserve it and create a volume from the created claim:

`const vol = new kplus.AwsElasticBlockStorePersistentVolume(chart, 'Volume', { volumeId: 'vol1234' });
container.mount('/data', vol);
`

## Bind[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pv/#bind "Permanent link")

Binding is a part of the reservation process, but it only creates a one directional link. You can use it to bind a PV to an existing PVC. Note however that if the PVC is not bound to the PV, there’s no guarantee this volume will indeed be given that specific claim.

`const claim = kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim.fromClaimName('claim');

// will modify the vol resource to refer to the claim.
// but no the other way around.
vol.bind(claim);

# PersistentVolumeClaim[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pvc/#persistentvolumeclaim "Permanent link")

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) is a request for storage by a pod.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#persistent-volume-claim)

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` contains the requirements of the request, and the Kubernetes control plane is responsible providing a physical volume that satisfies the claim’s requirements.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod');
const container = pod.addContainer({ image: 'node' });

// create the storage request
const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
});

// mount a volume based on the request to the container
// this will also add the volume itself to the pod spec.
container.mount('/data', kplus.Volume.fromPersistentVolumeClaim(claim));
`

## Storage Class[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pvc/#storage-class "Permanent link")

By default, the `storageClassName` property of a claim is not set. This means that the backing volume can be provided by one of two methods:

1. Dynamically provision a volume with the default storage class.
2. If a default storage class is not configured in the cluster, the backing volume must pre-exist and not be assigned to any storage class.

> See [Provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#provisioning) for more details.

You can also provide an explicit storage class name,

`const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
  storageClassName: 'large-ebs',
});
`

In this case, Kubernetes control plane will either locate an existing volume with the `larg-ebs` storage class, or dynamically provision a new using the appropriate provisioner.

You can also pass in a special `""` value, this means the volume must not be assigned to any storage class. Since all dynamically provisioend volumes belong to a storage class, setting this value effectively disables dynamic provisioning for this claim.

`const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
  // disable dynamic provisioning
  storageClassName: "",
});
`

## Bind[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/pvc/#bind "Permanent link")

Binding is a part of the reservation process, but it only creates a one directional link. You can use it to bind a PVC to an existing PV. Note however that if the PV is not bound to the PVC, there’s no guarantee this claim will indeed be given to that specific volume.

`const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
});

const vol = kplus.PersistentVolume.fromPersistentVolumeName('vol');

// will modify the claim resource to refer to the volume.
// but no the other way around.
claim.bind(vol);

# Role Based Access Control[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/rbac/#role-based-access-control "Permanent link")

Role Based Access Control(RBAC) helps you restrict actions that can be performed on specific Kubernetes resources. To make this possible, RBAC lets you create roles with rules which define access permissions for your specified resource.

These roles can then be binded to Kubernetes subjects, which could be User, Group or ServiceAccount.

Note

Rules or permissions are purely additive and there are no deny rules.

Now, there are two types of roles available, \* Role: These set permissions within a particular namespace i.e. is for namespaced resources, like, pods, deployments. \* ClusterRole: These set permissions for non-namespaced resources, like, nodes, urls.

and, similarly there are two types of binding available, \* RoleBinding: These grant permissions within a specific namespace. \* ClusterRoleBinding: These grant cluster wide permissions .

## Role[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/rbac/#role "Permanent link")

### Create role and add rules to it[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/rbac/#create-role-and-add-rules-to-it "Permanent link")

`` import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Creating RBAC Role
    const role = new kplus.Role(this, 'SampleRole');

    // The convenience method here `allowReadWrite` would add
    // `get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete,
    // deletecollection` rules to the role for deployment resources.
    role.allowReadWrite(kplus.ApiResource.DEPLOYMENTS);

    const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
    const group = kplus.Group.fromName(this, 'SampleGroup', 'sample-group');
    const serviceAccount = new kplus.ServiceAccount(this, 'SampleServiceAccount');

    // You can bind this role to a specific user, group or service account
    role.bind(user, group, serviceAccount);
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'rbac-docs');
app.synth();
 ``

## ClusterRole[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/rbac/#clusterrole "Permanent link")

### Create ClusterRole and add rules to it[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/rbac/#create-clusterrole-and-add-rules-to-it "Permanent link")

`// Creating RBAC ClusterRole
const clusterRole = new kplus.ClusterRole(this, 'SampleClusterRole');

// Adding list of rules to the ClusterRole for 'Nodes' and 'URL' non-namespaced resource
clusterRole.allowReadWrite(kplus.ApiResource.NODES, kplus.NonApiResource.of('/healthz'));

const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
const group = kplus.Group.fromName(this, 'SampleGroup', 'sample-group');
const serviceAccount = new kplus.ServiceAccount(this, 'SampleServiceAccount');

// You can bind this cluster role to a specific user, group or service account
clusterRole.bind(user, group, serviceAccount);
`

## Resource Permission Methods[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/rbac/#resource-permission-methods "Permanent link")

You can use convenience methods like `grantRead` and `grantReadWrite` which would make it easier to grant list of subjects set of permissions for the resource.

### `grantReadWrite` Method[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/rbac/#grantreadwrite-method "Permanent link")

`// Creating a Pod resource
const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod', {
    containers: [{ image: 'image' }],
});

const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
const group = kplus.Group.fromName(this, 'SampleGroup', 'sample-group');
const serviceAccount = new kplus.ServiceAccount(this, 'SampleServiceAccount');

// You can grant permissions to specific user, group or service account.
pod.permissions.grantReadWrite(user, group, serviceAccount);
`

## Add subjects to an already bound role[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/rbac/#add-subjects-to-an-already-bound-role "Permanent link")

`const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
const binding = role.bind(user);

const anotherUser = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'AnotherSampleUser', 'James');
binding.addSubjects(anotherUser);

# Secret[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/secret/#secret "Permanent link")

Secrets are used to store confidential information. Never store such information on the definition of the pod itself.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#secret)

## Use an existing `Secret`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/secret/#use-an-existing-secret "Permanent link")

To reference a secret created outside of your deployment definition, use the following. Note that this does not create a new object, and will therefore not be included in the resulting manifest.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const secret = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName('aws-creds');
`

## Adding data[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/secret/#adding-data "Permanent link")

To create a new secret with some data, use:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const secret = new kplus.Secret(chart, 'Secret');
secret.addStringData('password', 'some-encrypted-data');

# ServiceAccount[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/service-account/#serviceaccount "Permanent link")

Use service accounts to provide an identity for pods.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#serviceaccount)

## Use an existing `ServiceAccount`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/service-account/#use-an-existing-serviceaccount "Permanent link")

To reference a service account created outside of your deployment definition, use the following. Note that this does not create a new object, and will therefore not be included in the resulting manifest.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const serviceAccount = kplus.ServiceAccount.fromServiceAccountName('aws-service');
`

## Allowing access to secrets[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/service-account/#allowing-access-to-secrets "Permanent link")

To create a new service account, and give it access to some secrets, use the following:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const awsCreds = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName('aws-creds');
const awsService = new kplus.ServiceAccount(chart, 'AWS');

// give access to the aws creds secret.
awsService.addSecret(awsCreds);
`

# Service[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/service/#service "Permanent link")

Use services when you want to expose a set of pods using a stable network identity. They can also be used for externalizing endpoints to clients outside of the kubernetes cluster.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#service)

## Selectors[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/service/#selectors "Permanent link")

Services must be configured with selectors that tell it which pods should it serve. The most common selector method is using labels.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');
const frontends = new kplus.Service(chart, 'FrontEnds');

// this will cause the service to select all pods with the 'run: frontend' label.
frontends.select(kplus.LabelSelector.equals('run', 'frontend'));
`

## Ports[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/service/#ports "Permanent link")

Ports that the service will listen and redirect to can be configured like so:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');
const frontends = new kplus.Service(chart, 'FrontEnds');

// make the service bind to port 9000 and redirect to port 80 on the associated containers.
frontends.bind({port: 9000, targetPort: 80)

# Volume[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/volume/#volume "Permanent link")

Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-30/typescript/#volume)

## Create from a ConfigMap[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/volume/#create-from-a-configmap "Permanent link")

A very useful operation is to create a volume from a `ConfigMap`. Kubernetes will translate every key in the config map to a file, who’s content is the value of the key.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const configMap = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName('redis-config');
const configVolume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(configMap);
`

## Create from an EmptyDir[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-30/volume/#create-from-an-emptydir "Permanent link")

The easiest way to allocate some persistent storage to your container is to create a volume from an empty directory. This volume, as the name suggests, is initially empty, and can be written to by containers who mount it. The data in the volume is preserved throughout the lifecycle of the pod, but is deleted forever as soon as the pod itself is removed.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-30';

const data = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir(configMap);

const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
const redis = pod.addContainer({
  image: 'redis'
})

// mount to the redis container.
redis.mount('/var/lib/redis', data);

# ConfigMap[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/config-map/#configmap "Permanent link")

ConfigMap are used to store configuration data. They provide a dictionary based data structure that can be consumed in various shapes and forms.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#configmap)

## Use an existing `ConfigMap`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/config-map/#use-an-existing-configmap "Permanent link")

You can reference to an existing `ConfigMap` like so. Note that this does not create a new object, and will therefore not be included in the resulting manifest.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: ChartProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const config: kplus.IConfigMap = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName(this, 'ConfigMap', 'config');

    // the 'config' constant can later be used by API's that require an IConfigMap.
    // for example when creating a volume.
    kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(this, 'Volume', config);
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'VolumeFromConfigMap');
app.synth();
`

## Adding data[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/config-map/#adding-data "Permanent link")

You can create config maps and add some data to them like so:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: ChartProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const config = new kplus.ConfigMap(this, 'Config');
    config.addData('url', 'https://my-endpoint:8080');
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'ConfigMap');
app.synth();
`

## Creating a volume from a directory[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/config-map/#creating-a-volume-from-a-directory "Permanent link")

Here is a nifty little trick you can use to create a volume that contains a directory on the client machine (machine that runs `cdk8s synth`):

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import * as path from 'path';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: ChartProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    const appMap = new kplus.ConfigMap(this, 'Config');

    // add the files in the directory to the config map.
    // this will create a key for each file.
    // note: this directory needs to exist
    // note: that only top level files will be included, sub-directories are not yet supported.
    appMap.addDirectory(path.join(__dirname, 'app'));

    const appVolume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(this, 'ConfigMap', appMap);

    const mountPath = '/var/app';
    const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
    const container = pod.addContainer({
      image: 'node',
      command: [ 'node', 'app.js' ],
      workingDir: mountPath,
    });

    // from here, just mount the volume to a container, and run your app!
    container.mount(mountPath, appVolume);
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'AppWithDir');
app.synth();

# Container[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/container/#container "Permanent link")

Define containers that run in a pod using the `Container` class.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#container)

## Environment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/container/#environment "Permanent link")

A container’s environment can be populated by various methods.

### Variables[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/container/#variables "Permanent link")

Environment variables can be added to containers by specifying the variable name and value. The value can come from different sources, either dynamic or static.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
    const container = pod.addContainer({
      image: 'my-app'
    });

    // use a static value.
    container.env.addVariable('endpoint', kplus.EnvValue.fromValue('value'));

    // use a specific key from a config map.
    const backendsConfig = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName(this, 'BackendConfig', 'backends');
    container.env.addVariable('endpoint', kplus.EnvValue.fromConfigMap(backendsConfig, 'endpoint'));

    // use a specific key from a secret.
    const credentials = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName(this, 'Credentials', 'credentials');
    container.env.addVariable('password', kplus.EnvValue.fromSecretValue({ secret: credentials, key: 'password' }));
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'container');
app.synth();
`

### Sources[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/container/#sources "Permanent link")

Environment variables can also be populated by referencing other objects as an environment source. With this method, all the key-value data of the source is added as environment variables, where the key is the env name and the value is the env value.

`const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
const cm = new kplus.ConfigMap(this, 'ConfigMap', {
  data: {
    key: 'value',
  }
});
const container = pod.addContainer({
  image: 'my-app'
});

// this will add 'key=value' env variable at runtime.
container.env.copyFrom(kplus.Env.fromConfigMap(cm));
`

## Volume Mounts[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/container/#volume-mounts "Permanent link")

A very common capability is to mount a volume with some data onto a container. Using pure kubernetes API, this would require writing something like:

`kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: main
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /path/to/mount
          name: 'config-volume'
  volumes:
    - name: 'config-volume'
      configMap:
        name: 'config'
`

Notice the apparent redundancy of having to specify the volume name twice. Also, if you happen to need the same mount in other pods, you would need to duplicate this configuration. This can get complex and cluttered very fast.

In contrast, here is how to do this with `cdk8s+`:

`const config = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName(this, 'Config', 'config');
const volume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(this, 'Volume', config);

const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
const container = pod.addContainer({
  image: 'my-app'
})

// Cool alert: every pod that will later be configured with this container,
// will automatically have access to this volume, so you don't need to explicitly add it to the pod spec!.
container.mount('/path/to/mount', volume);
`

## Probes[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/container/#probes "Permanent link")

A [Probe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#probe-v1-core) is a diagnostic performed periodically by the kubelet on a Container. To perform a diagnostic, the kubelet calls a Handler implemented by the container.

A `Probe` instance can be created through one of the `fromXxx` static methods:

* `Probe.fromHttpGet()`
* `Probe.fromCommand()`

Readiness, liveness, and startup probes can be configured at the container-level through the `readiness`, `liveness`, and `startup` options:

`new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod', {
  containers: [
    {
      image: 'my-app',
      readiness: kplus.Probe.fromHttpGet('/ping'),
    }
  ]
});
`

# CronJob[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/cronjob/#cronjob "Permanent link")

CronJob resource is responsible for creating recurring [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/). The job recurrence is determined by a [Cron](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/blob/2.x/src/cron.ts) expression.

CronJob is similar to a [job](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/job/) but it is suitable when there is a need to run a job indefinitely following a schedule. These repetitive jobs can be utilized for recurring tasks such as backing up a database, pinging a server for health checks, creating snapshots of systems and much more.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#cronjob)

## Creating a `CronJob`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/cronjob/#creating-a-cronjob "Permanent link")

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps, Cron } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new kplus.CronJob(this, 'CronJob', {
      containers: [{
        image: 'databack/mysql-backup',
      }],
      // You can pass a custom cron schedule using our Cron class
      schedule: Cron.schedule({
        minute: '*',
        hour: '*',
        day: '*',
        month: '*',
        weekDay: '*',
      }),
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'cronjob-readme');
app.synth();
`

### Defaults[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/cronjob/#defaults "Permanent link")

The above would create a cronjob resource which would schedule `databack/mysql-backup` to run every minute. With this resource, we also set some meaningful defaults. For instance, this cronjob would not run jobs concurrently by default. It will also retain 3 instance of successful job runs and 1 instance of a failed run for debugging later if needed. To customize the properties, see [API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#cronjob).

### Helper Functions[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/cronjob/#helper-functions "Permanent link")

As we see in the previous example, we can pass custom cron expression for scheduling our jobs. But, we have also have added helper functions that would make it easy to mention some of the commonly used schedules. These include scheduling jobs to run every minute, hour, day, week, month or year. For instance, the same example mentioned before could be written as,

`new kplus.CronJob(this, 'CronJob', {
  containers: [{
    image: 'databack/mysql-backup',
  }],
  // This would schedule jobs to be scheduled to run every minute
  schedule: Cron.everyMinute(),
});
`

### Validations[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/cronjob/#validations "Permanent link")

The cronjob construct also validates some of the properties so that the manifest created works as expected.

* You cannot pass `startingDeadline` property value less that 10 seconds. This is because the Kubernetes CronJobController checks things every 10 seconds and if the value passed is less than that then the jobs would not be scheduled.
* `ttlAfterFinished` job property limits the lifetime of a job that has finished execution. You cannot pass the `ttlAfterFinished` property with any/both of the `successfulJobsRetained` and `failedJobsRetained` property since this would not let retention of jobs work in an expected manner.

# Deployment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/deployment/#deployment "Permanent link")

Create a deployment to govern the lifecycle and orchestration of a set of identical pods.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#deployment)

## Automatic pod selection[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/deployment/#automatic-pod-selection "Permanent link")

When you specify pods in a deployment, you normally have to configure the appropriate labels and selectors to make the deployment control the relevant pods. This construct does this automatically.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new kplus.Deployment(this, 'FrontEnds', {
      containers: [ { image: 'node' } ],
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'deployment');
app.synth();
`

Note the resulting manifest contains a special `cdk8s.io/metadata.addr` label that is applied to the pods, and is used as the selector for the deployment.

`apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-frontends-c8e48310
spec:
  minReadySeconds: 0
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 600
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      cdk8s.io/metadata.addr: deployment-FrontEnds-c89e9e97
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        cdk8s.io/metadata.addr: deployment-FrontEnds-c89e9e97
    spec:
      automountServiceAccountToken: false
      containers:
        - image: node
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          name: main
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: 1500m
              memory: 2048Mi
            requests:
              cpu: 1000m
              memory: 512Mi
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            privileged: false
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
            runAsGroup: 26000
            runAsNonRoot: true
            runAsUser: 25000
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      securityContext:
        fsGroupChangePolicy: Always
        runAsNonRoot: true
      setHostnameAsFQDN: false
`

## Exposing via a service[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/deployment/#exposing-via-a-service "Permanent link")

Following up on pod selection, you can also easily create a service that will select the pods relevant to the deployment.

`// store the deployment to created in a constant
const frontends = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'FrontEnds', {
  containers: [ {
    image: 'node',
    portNumber: 9000,
  } ],
});

// create a ClusterIP service that listens on port 9000 and redirects to port 9000 on the containers.
frontends.exposeViaService({ ports: [{
  port: 9000,
}]
});
`

Notice the resulting manifest, will have the same `cdk8s.io/metadata.addr` magic label as the selector. This will cause the service to attach to the pods that were configured as part of the said deployment.

`apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-frontends-c8e48310
spec:
  minReadySeconds: 0
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 600

## Scheduling[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/deployment/#scheduling "Permanent link")

In addition to the scheduling capabilities provided by [pod scheduling](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#scheduling), a Deployment offers the following:

### Spreading[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/deployment/#spreading "Permanent link")

A spread is a [separation](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#pod-separation) of pods from themselves. It can be used to ensure replicas of the same workload are scheduled on different topologies.

> The same API is also available on all workload resources (i.e `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, `DaemonSet`).

`const redis = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }],
  replicas: 3,
});

redis.scheduling.spread({
  topology: kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME
});
`

This example ensures that each replica of the `Redis` deployment will be scheduled on a different node.

Take, for [example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#more-practical-use-cases), a three-node cluster running a web application with an in-memory cache like redis. You’d like to co-locate the web servers with the cache as much as possible, while still maintaining node failure resistance. (i.e not all pods are on the same node).

Here is how you can accomplish that:

`const redis = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }],
  replicas: 3,
});

const web = new kplus.Deployment(this, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
  replicas: 3,
});

// ensure redis is spread across all nodes
redis.scheduling.spread({
  topology: kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME
});

// ensure web app is spread across all nodes
web.scheduling.spread({
  topology: kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME
});

// ensure a web app pod always runs along side a cache instance
web.scheduling.colocate(redis);
`

# HorizontalPodAutoscaler[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#horizontalpodautoscaler "Permanent link")

HorizontalPodAutoscaler allows your services to scale up when demand is high and scale down when they are no longer needed.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#horizontalpodautoscaler)

## Using a HorizontalPodAutoscaler[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#using-a-horizontalpodautoscaler "Permanent link")

The example below creates a HorizontalPodAutoscaler that scales the number of replicas of a Deployment based on the average CPU utilization of the pods.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

// Lets create a deployment for our web server
const bookstoreWebsite = new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'BookstoreWebsite', {
  containers: [ { image: 'node' } ],
});

// Now define a HorizontalPodAutoscaler
const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.resourceCpu(kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(70)),
  ],
 });
// This will scale our website deployment up when the average CPU utilization
// is 70% or higher up to a maximum of 10 replicas.
`

Using the example above, if our web server passes 70% CPU utilization the autoscaler will try and figure out the number of replicas to scale.

The autoscaler uses the following formula:

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[currentReplicas \* ( currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue )\]

Based on this formula we can find out how many replicas will be scaled. For example if we have 1 replica and the CPU utilization is at 70%.

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[1 \* ( 70 / 70 )\] = 1

The autoscaler will try and add 1 replica, meaning we’ll have 2 web servers running, the original and the new replica.

If the CPU utilization is 140% the autoscaler will try and provision 2 replicas. Scaling us up to 3 web servers total.

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[1 \* ( 140 / 70 )\] = 2

This works the same way when scaling down.

For example if our target CPU utilization is 70% and we have 3 replicas running and the CPU utilization is at 50%.

> desiredReplicas = ceil\[3 \* ( 50 / 70 )\] = 2

The autoscaler will try and remove 1 replica, meaning we’ll have 2 web servers running, the original and the new replica.

## Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#metrics "Permanent link")

The HorizontalPodAutoscaler supports the following metrics:

### Resource Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#resource-metrics "Permanent link")

Resource metrics are used to scale on a resource like CPU or memory.

Since the resource usages of all the containers are summed up the total pod utilization may not accurately represent the individual container resource usage. This could lead to situations where a single container might be running with high usage and the HPA will not scale out because the overall pod usage is still within acceptable limits.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.resourceCpu(kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(70)),
  ],
 });
`

### Pods Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#pods-metrics "Permanent link")

Pods metrics are used to scale on a metric describing each pod in the current scale target (for example, transactions-processed-per-second).

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.pods({
      name: 'requests-per-second',
      target: kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(50),
      labelSelector: kplus.LabelSelector.of({ labels: { app: 'scraper' } }),
    }),
  ],
 });
`

## Container Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#container-metrics "Permanent link")

Container metrics are used to scale on one of the scaling target’s container metrics.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.containerMemory(kplus.MetricTarget.value(4096)),
  ],
 });
`

### Object Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#object-metrics "Permanent link")

Object metrics are used to scale on a metric describing a single kubernetes object (for example, requests-per-second on an Ingress object).

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.object({
        object: ingress,
        name: 'requests-per-second',
        target: kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(50),
      }),
  ],
});
`

### External Metrics[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#external-metrics "Permanent link")

External metrics are used to scale on a metric not associated with any Kubernetes object (for example, an SQS queue).

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';


const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
    kplus.Metric.external({
      labelSelector: kplus.LabelSelector.of({ labels: { app: 'scraper' } }),
      name: 'sqs-queue',
      target: kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(50),
    }),
  ],
 });
`

## Scaling behavior[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#scaling-behavior "Permanent link")

The HorizontalPodAutoscaler has a few options to control the scaling behavior.

### scaleUp /scaleDown[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/#scaleup-scaledown "Permanent link")

The `scaleUp` / `scaleDown` options controls how fast the HorizontalPodAutoscaler scales up and down. They share the same options but have slightly different defaults.

`const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  scaleUp: {
    stabilizationWindow: 60,
    policies: [
      kplus.PolicyType.pods(4),
      kplus.PolicyType.percent(200),
    ],
  },
  scaleDown: {
    stabilizationWindow: 60,
    policies: [
      kplus.PolicyType.pods(2),
      kplus.PolicyType.percent(100),
    ],
  },
 });
`

| strategy            | Determines if the the Autoscaler should scale as much or as little as possible.                                                 | ScalingStrategy.MAX\_CHANGE Choose the scaling policy that will scale the most replicas.   | ScalingStrategy.MIN\_CHANGE Choose the scaling policy that will scale the least replicas. |
| policies            | Defines how many replicas are scaled. Can be an absolute number or a percentage of the current replica count.                   | \* Increase no more than 4 pods per 60 seconds \* Double the number of pods per 60 seconds | \* Decrease to minReplica count (default 1)                                               |

Check out the example below. We have a `scaleUp` policy that will scale up by 4 pods or double the current number of pods per 60 seconds. Because the `strategy` has been configured to `ScalingStrategy.MAX_CHANGE` the autoscaler will choose the policy that will make the most replicas.

`const hpa = new kplus.HorizontalPodAutoscaler(chart, 'BookstoreWebsiteHpa', {
  target: bookstoreWebsite,
  maxReplicas: 10,
  metrics: [
     kplus.Metric.resourceCpu(kplus.MetricTarget.averageUtilization(70)),
  ],
  scaleUp: {
    strategy: kplus.ScalingStrategy.MAX_CHANGE,
    stabilizationWindow: 60,
    policies: [
      kplus.PolicyType.pods(4),
      kplus.PolicyType.percent(200),
    ],
  },
 });
`

This means that if we currently have 3 web server pods, and the CPU utilization is at 72% the autoscaler will try and add 6 pods every 60 seconds.

This will result in a total of 9 web server pods. If after 60 seconds the CPU utilization is still at 72% the autoscaler will only be allowed to add one more replica because `maxReplicas` has been configured to 10.

For more information on HorizontalPodAutoscaler check out the [API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript.md#horizontalpodautoscaler).

# Ingress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/ingress/#ingress "Permanent link")

[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) manages external access to services in a cluster, typically through HTTP. Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#ingressv1beta1)

You must have an [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers) to satisfy an Ingress. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect.

The following example will route HTTP requests sent to the `/hello` url prefix to a service associated with a deployment of the[hashicorp/http-echo](https://github.com/hashicorp/http-echo) image.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const helloDeployment = new kplus.Deployment(this, "Deployment", {
      containers: [
        {
          image: 'hashicorp/http-echo',
          args: [ '-text', 'hello ingress' ],
          portNumber: 5678,
        }
      ]
    });

    const helloService = helloDeployment.exposeViaService({
        ports: [
          {
            port: 5678,
          }
        ]
      });

    const ingress = new kplus.Ingress(this, 'ingress');
    ingress.addRule('/hello', kplus.IngressBackend.fromService(helloService));
 }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'ingress');
app.synth();
`

You can use `addHostRule(host, path, backend)` to define a route that will only apply to requests with this `Host` header. This can be used to implement virtual hosts.

The `addDefaultBackend(backend)` and `addHostDefaultBackend(host, backend)`methods can be used to define backends that will accept all requests that do not match any other rules.

The TCP port used to route requests to services will be determined based on which ports are exposed by the service (e.g. through `serve()`). If the service exposes multiple ports, then a port must be specified via`IngressBackend.fromService(service, { port })`.

# Job[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/job/#job "Permanent link")

Jobs are a very useful concept in kubernetes deployments. They can be used for add-hoc provisioning tasks, as well as long running processing jobs.

In configuration, they don’t differ much from regular pods, but offer some additional properties.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#job)

## Delete a Job after its finished[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/job/#delete-a-job-after-its-finished "Permanent link")

You can configure a TTL for the job after it finished its execution successfully.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps, Duration } from 'cdk8s';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // let's define a job spec, and set a 1 second TTL.
    const job = new kplus.Job(this, 'LoadData', {
      ttlAfterFinished: Duration.seconds(1)
    });

    // now add a container to all the pods created by this job
    job.addContainer({
      image: 'loader'
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'Job');
app.synth();
`

## Scheduling[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/job/#scheduling "Permanent link")

See [Deployment scheduling](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/deployment/#scheduling).

## Connections[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/job/#connections "Permanent link")

# Namespace[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/namespace/#namespace "Permanent link")

Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#namespace)

## Create a `Namespace`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/namespace/#create-a-namespace "Permanent link")

To create a new namespace in the cluster:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const namespace = new kplus.Namespace(chart, 'BackOfficeNamespace');
`

Like any other resource, if you don’t specify a name, cdk8s will auto-generate one, which you can access by `namespace.name`.

## Select namespaces[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/namespace/#select-namespaces "Permanent link")

Namespaces can also be selected by various mechanisms. These selections are often used in other cdk8s+ API’s, such as [pod selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#pod-selection) during scheduling.

### Select namespaces by name[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/namespace/#select-namespaces-by-name "Permanent link")

Select a namespace called `backoffice`.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const backoffice = kplus.Namespaces.select(this, 'Backoffice', { names: ['backoffice'] });
`

### Select namespace by labels[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/namespace/#select-namespace-by-labels "Permanent link")

Select all namespaces that have the `processing=batch` label.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const batch = kplus.Namespaces.select(this, 'Batch', { labels: { processing: 'batch'} });
`

### Select all namespaces[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/namespace/#select-all-namespaces "Permanent link")

Select all namespaces in the cluster.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const all = kplus.Namespaces.all();

# Network Policy[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#network-policy "Permanent link")

Network policies control inter-pod traffic flow at the IP address or port level (OSI layer 3 or 4). By default, a pod is opened in the network (or _non-isolated_). That is, it can initiate any outgoing traffic, and accept any incoming traffic.

When network policies are applied to pods, they lose this default behavior and become restricted, or _isolated_. This means that as soon as a policy in a specific direction applies to a pod, that pod stops being open in that direction. We refer to such pods as **isolated**. There are two sorts of isolation for a pod: isolation for egress, and isolation for ingress.

Network policies do not conflict; they are additive. If any policy or policies apply to a given pod for a given direction, the connections allowed in that direction from that pod is the union of what the applicable policies allow. Thus, order of evaluation does not affect the policy result.

For a connection from a source pod to a destination pod to be allowed, both the egress policy on the source pod and the ingress policy on the destination pod need to allow the connection. If either side does not allow the connection, it will not happen.

## Create a `NetworkPolicy`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#create-a-networkpolicy "Permanent link")

A network policy is a namespaced resource that applies to specific pods in that namespace. The pods are specified using the `selector` property, and can accept a few different objects:

### Managed Pod[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#managed-pod "Permanent link")

A managed pod is a pod that is created by the current cdk8s application. That is, its simply an instance of a `Pod`. You can pass that instance to be used as the selector. The policy will be applied only to that **specific** pod.

> Under the hood, this uses a magic `cdk8s.io/metadata.address` label that uniquely identifies pods, and is added automatically by cdk8s.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', { selector: web });
`

### Managed Workload[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#managed-workload "Permanent link")

Exactly as for a managed `Pod`, you can pass an instance of any workload resource (e.g `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, …)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', { selector: web });
`

### Selected Pods[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#selected-pods "Permanent link")

If you’d like to create a policy for pods that aren’t managed by the current cdk8s application, you use [selected pods](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#select-pods).

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = kplus.Pods.select(chart, 'Web', { labels: { app: 'web' }});

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', { selector: web });
`

This policy will apply to **all** pods with label `app=web`.

## Ip Block[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#ip-block "Permanent link")

An Ip Block defines a range of IP addresses using CIDR notation. You can define both `ipv4` and `ipv6` ranges:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

// define a specific ipv4 range
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.ipv4('172.17.0.0/16');

// define a specific ipv6 range
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.ipv6('2002::1234:abcd:ffff:c0a8:101/64');

// define all ipv4 addresses
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.anyIpv4();

// define all ipv6 addresses
kplus.NetworkPolicyIpBlock.anyIpv6();
`

Ip blocks can later be used as network policy [peers](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#peers).

## Peers[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#peers "Permanent link")

The selector of a policy is defined at construction time and there can only be one per policy. The peers constitute the second half of the connection – they are the resources or endpoints that the **selected** resources can communicate with. A policy can define rules for multiple peers, and a peer can be any one of:

* [Ip Block](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#ip-block): Will allow a connection with a CIDR range.
* [Managed Pod](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#managed-pod): Will establish a connection with specific pod.
* [Managed Workload](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#managed-workload): Will establish a connection with the pods of the workload.
* [Selected Pods](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#selected-pods): Will establish a connection with the selected pods.
* [Managed Namespace](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/namespace/): Will establish a connection with all pods in a specific namespace.
* [Selected Namespaces](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/namespace/#select-namespaces): Will establish a connection with all pods in the selected namespaces.

> You can also create a custom peer by implementing the `kplus.INetworkPolicyPeer` interface.

## Egress Rule[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#egress-rule "Permanent link")

Isolating pods for egress traffic egress can be done either at, or post construction:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

const cache = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Cache', {
  containers: [{ image: 'cache', portNumber: 6379 }],
});

const db = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'DB', {
  containers: [{ image: 'db', portNumber: 6378 }],
});

// create a policy with an egress rule at instantiation
const webPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  selector: web,
  egress: { rules: [{ peer: cache, ports: [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]}] },
});

// add an egress rule post instantiation
webPolicy.addEgressRule(db, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6378)]);
`

## Ingress Rule[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#ingress-rule "Permanent link")

Isolating pods for ingress traffic ingress can be done either at, or post construction:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
});

const cache = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Cache', {
  containers: [{ image: 'cache', portNumber: 6379 }],
});

const db = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'DB', {
  containers: [{ image: 'db', portNumber: 6378 }],
});

// create a policy with an ingress rule at instantiation
const dbPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  selector: db,
  ingress: { rule: [{ peer: web, ports: [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]}] },
});

// add an ingress rule post instantiation
redis.addIngressRule(cache, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]);
`

## Bi-directional Rule[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#bi-directional-rule "Permanent link")

As mentioned earlier, for a connection from a source pod to a destination pod to be allowed, both the egress policy on the source pod and the ingress policy on the destination pod need to allow the connection. Using network policies, this could be tricky, especially if the pods are in different namespace:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n1' },
});

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n2' },
});

const webPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'WebPolicy', {
  selector: web,
  // must be created in the 'web' namespace so it can select it.
  metadata: { namespace: web.metadata.namespace }
});
const redisPolicy = new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'RedisPolicy', {
  selector: redis,
  // must be created in the 'redis' namespace so it can select it.
  metadata: { namespace: redis.metadata.namespace }
});

// allow the 'web' pod to initiate a connection to the 'redis' pod on port 6379
webPolicy.addEgressRule(redis, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]);

// allow the 'redis' pod to accept a connection from the 'web' pod on port 6379
redis.addIngressRule(web, [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(6379)]);
`

If the source pod of your connection is a [managed pod](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#managed-pod)(or [managed workload](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#managed-workload)), the same thing can be achieved much easier:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n1' },
});

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }],
  metadata: { namespace: 'n2' },
});

web.connections.allowTo(redis);
// or
redis.connections.allowFrom(web);
`

See [pod connections](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#connections) for more details.

## Default Policies[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#default-policies "Permanent link")

Every policy can specify what behavior should apply when no rules are specified in a given direction. You can use that to create default policies that either deny or allow all traffic.

### Deny All Ingress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#deny-all-ingress "Permanent link")

> See [default-deny-all-ingress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#default-deny-all-ingress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  ingress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.DENY },
});
`

This ensures that even pods that aren’t selected by any other network policy will still be isolated for ingress. This policy does not affect isolation for egress from any pod.

### Allow All Ingress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#allow-all-ingress "Permanent link")

> See [allow-all-ingress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#allow-all-ingress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  ingress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.ALLOW },
});
`

With this policy in place, no additional policy or policies can cause any incoming connection to those pods to be denied. This policy has no effect on isolation for egress from any pod.

Tip

This differs from the default `DENY` isolation behavior, which is effectively disabled when other policies are applied.

### Deny All Egress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#deny-all-egress "Permanent link")

> See [default-deny-all-egress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#default-deny-all-egress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  egress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.DENY },
});
`

This ensures that even pods that aren’t selected by any other NetworkPolicy will not be allowed egress traffic. This policy does not change the ingress isolation behavior of any pod.

### Allow All Egress[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#allow-all-egress "Permanent link")

> See [allow-all-egress-traffic](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#allow-all-egress-traffic)

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

new kplus.NetworkPolicy(chart, 'Policy', {
  egress: { default: kplus.NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault.ALLOW },
});
`

With this policy in place, no additional policy or policies can cause any outgoing connection from those pods to be denied. This policy has no effect on isolation for ingress to any pod.

Tip

This differs from the default `DENY` isolation behavior, which is effectively disabled when other policies are applied.

# Pod[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#pod "Permanent link")

A pod is essentially a collection of containers. It is the most fundamental computation unit that can be provisioned.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#pod)

## Create a `Pod`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#create-a-pod "Permanent link")

To create a new pod in the cluster:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod');
`

### Adding Containers[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#adding-containers "Permanent link")

Every `Pod` must have at least one container before you synthesize the application. You can add containers either during, or post instantiation:

`const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  containers: [{ image: 'image' }],
});

pod.addContainer({ image: 'another-image' });
`

### Adding Volumes[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#adding-volumes "Permanent link")

Volumes can be added to pod definition either during, or post instantiation:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const data1 = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir('data1');
const data2 = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir('data2');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  volumes: [data1],
});

pod.addVolume(data2);
`

Note that adding a volume to a pod doesn’t actually make the volume available to its containers. For that, you also need to mount the volume onto a container.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const data = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir('data');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod');
const container = pod.addContainer({ image: 'image' });

// mount the volume onto the container. this is actually enough, and you
// don't need to explicitly add the volume to the pod -- cdk8s+ will do that for you.
container.mount('/data', data);
`

### Applying a restart policy[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#applying-a-restart-policy "Permanent link")

A restart policy can only be specified at instantiation time:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  restartPolicy: kplus.RestartPolicy.NEVER,
});
`

### Assigning a ServiceAccount[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#assigning-a-serviceaccount "Permanent link")

A service account can only be specified at instantiation time:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod', {
  serviceAccount: kplus.ServiceAccount.fromServiceAccountName('aws'),
});
`

## Select pods[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#select-pods "Permanent link")

Pods can also be selected by various mechanisms. These selections are often used in other cdk8s+ API’s, such as [pod selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#pod-selection) during scheduling.

### Select pods with labels[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#select-pods-with-labels "Permanent link")

Selects all pods that have the `app=store` label.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const pods = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Store', { labels: { app: 'store' }});
`

### Select pods with expressions[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#select-pods-with-expressions "Permanent link")

Selects all pods that have the `app` label, regardless of the value.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const pods = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'App', {
  expressions: [kplus.LabelExpression.exists('app')]
});
`

### Select pods with labels in a particular namespace[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#select-pods-with-labels-in-a-particular-namespace "Permanent link")

Pod selection can also be scoped to specific namespaces. This is done using the `namespaces` property, which can accept any [namespace selector](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/namespace/#select-namespaces).

For example, select all pods that have the `app=store` label in the `backoffice` namespace:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const pods = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Pods', {
  labels: { app: 'store' },
  namespaces: kplus.Namespaces.select(this, 'Backoffice', { names: ['backoffice'] }),
});
`

## Scheduling[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#scheduling "Permanent link")

Kubernetes offers a few properties for controlling how pods are scheduled onto nodes.

* [nodeName](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodename)
* [nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
* [nodeAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity)
* [podAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity)
* [podAntiAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity)
* [tolearations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/)

CDK8s+ collapses all these different features and exposes them under one unified API we refer to as `Scheduling`. This API is available on a `Pod` via the `scheduling` property.

> The same API is also available on all workload resources (i.e `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, `DaemonSet`).

Scheduling is comprised of two different types:

* [Node Selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#node-selection)
* [Pod Selection](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#pod-selection)

### Node Selection[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#node-selection "Permanent link")

Node selection is the process of directly selecting which nodes should pods be scheduled on, by selecting node attributes.

#### Node Assignment[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#node-assignment "Permanent link")

You can statically assign a pod to a specific node, by using the node’s name.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
redis.scheduling.assign(kplus.Node.named('node1'));
`

This example will cause the `Redis` pod to be scheduled on a node with name `node1`.

#### Node Attraction[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#node-attraction "Permanent link")

Pods can attract themselves to nodes. As opposed to an assignment, an attraction can be made to a **set** of nodes, specified by node labels. An attraction can be either required, or preferred.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
const highMemoryNodes = kplus.Node.labeled(kplus.NodeLabelQuery.is('memory', 'high'));
redis.scheduling.attract(highMemoryNodes);
`

This example will **require** the `Redis` pod be scheduled on a node that has the `memory=high` label. To request a **preference**, specify the [weight](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-weight) property:

`redis.scheduling.attract(highMemoryNodes, { weight: 50 });
`

#### Node Toleration[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#node-toleration "Permanent link")

While attractions is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes, taints are the opposite – they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

Tolerations are applied to pods, and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node; this marks that the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints.

A toleration can be made to a **set** of nodes, specified by node taints.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});

const node = kplus.Node.tainted(kplus.NodeTaintQuery.is('key1', 'value1', {
  effect: kplus.TainEffect.NO_SCHEDULE
}));
redis.scheduling.tolerate(node);
`

This example says the the `Redis` pod is able to tolerate nodes tainted with `key1=value1:NoSchedule`.

### Pod Selection[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#pod-selection "Permanent link")

Pod selection is the process of selecting which **nodes** should pods be scheduled on, by looking at which other **pods** are already scheduled on those nodes.

The API’s presented here interact either with specific pods, i.e instances of `Pod` or `Workload` (e.g `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, …), or with a group of pods, i.e ones that are identified by a set of [selectors](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#select-pods).

#### Pod Co-location[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#pod-co-location "Permanent link")

Pod co-location is a way to tell the scheduler to place a pod in a _topology_that already hosts other pods that meet some criteria.

A topology is expressed via the `topology` property, and represents a failure domain that Kubernetes is aware of. It can be one of:

* `kplus.Topology.HOSTNAME`: A single node. This is the default value.
* `kplus.Topology.ZONE`: Multiple nodes in a single availability zone.
* `kplus.Topology.REGION`: Multiple nodes in a single region.
* `kplus.Topology.custom`: Any other configurable value.

Similarly to node attractions, co-location can also be either required, or preferred.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

web.scheduling.colocate(redis);
`

This example will require the `Web` pod to be scheduled on the same node as the `Redis` pod. To request a **preference**, specify the [weight](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-weight) property:

`web.scheduling.colocate(redis, { weight: 50 });
`

To use a different topology, specify the `topology` property:

`web.scheduling.colocate(redis, { weight: 50, topology: kplus.Topology.ZONE });
`

This scenario configures co-location between two pods that are defined and managed in the same cdk8s application. You can also co-locate with an externally managed pod, by specifying a pod selector:

`const redis = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Cache', {
  labels: { app: 'cache' },
});
web.scheduling.colocate(redis);
`

This will co-locate the `Web` pod with pods that have the `app=cache` label, regardless of whether they are defined in the cdk8s app or not.

> **Under the hood**: Co-location with managed pods will automatically extract its labels and form the appropriate pod selector.

#### Pod Separation[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#pod-separation "Permanent link")

Pod separation (e.g anti co-location) is a way to tell the scheduler **not to** place a pod in a _topology_ that already hosts other pods that meet some criteria. Similarly to co-location, separation can also be either required, or preferred.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis' }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

web.scheduling.separate(redis);
`

This example will require the `Web` pod to **not be** scheduled on the same node (because the default value of the topology is `HOSTNAME`) as the `Redis` pod. To request a **preference**, specify the [weight](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-weight) property:

`web.scheduling.separate(redis, { weight: 50 });
`

To use a different topology, specify the `topology` property:

`web.scheduling.separate(redis, { weight: 50, topology: kplus.Topology.ZONE });
`

This scenario configures separation between two pods that are defined and managed in the same cdk8s application. You can also separate with an externally managed pod, by specifying a pod selector:

`const redis = kplus.Pods.select(this, 'Cache', {
  labels: { app: 'cache' },
});
web.scheduling.separate(redis);
`

This will separate the `Web` pod from pods that have the `app=cache` label, regardless of whether they are defined in the cdk8s app or not.

> **Under the hood**: Co-location with managed pods will automatically extract its labels and form the appropriate pod selector.

## Connections[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#connections "Permanent link")

Pod connections offer a simplified API to automatically create [network policies](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/) on both ends of a connection. Accessing this API is done via the `connections` property of a specific `Pod`, which serves as one end of the connection. The other end is a network policy [peer](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#peers).

### Allow To[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#allow-to "Permanent link")

To allow connections from a `Pod` to a [peer](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#peers):

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

web.connections.allowTo(redis);
`

This will allow the `web` pod to connect to the `redis` port on port 6379, and will allow the `redis` pod to accept connections from the `web` pod on port 6379\. Note that the port is not specified in the `allowTo` invocation, it is automatically extracted from the `redis` pod definition.

You can also pass ports explicitly, overriding this extraction:

`web.connections.allowTo(redis, { ports: [kplus.NetworkPolicyPort.tcp(4444)] });
`

### Allow From[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#allow-from "Permanent link")

To allow connections from a [peer](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/network-policy/#peers) to a `Pod`:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const redis = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Redis', {
  containers: [{ image: 'redis', portNumber: 6379 }]
});
const web = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Web', {
  containers: [{ image: 'web' }]
});

redis.connections.allowFrom(web);
`

This will allow the `redis` pod to accept connection from the `web` pod on port 6379, and will allow the `web` pod to connect to the `redis` pod on port 6379\. Note that the port is not specified in the `allowFrom` invocation, it is automatically extracted from the `redis` pod definition.

### Isolation[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#isolation "Permanent link")

By default, the `allowXXX` methods will create both an egress policy on the initiating end, as well as an ingress policy on the accepting end of the connection.

This means that, if no other policies apply, both sides of the connection will be _isolated_, each in the corresponding direction. In the above [example](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pod/#allow-to), if the `redis` pod needs to be accessed from any pod other than `web`, an explicit policy needs to be applied, because the default _non-isolated_ behavior is now disabled.

To control the isolation this API incurs, you can use the `isolation` option. It accepts two possible values:

* `PodConnectionsIsolation.POD`: Only isolate the pod that offers the `connections` API.
* `PodConnectionsIsolation.PEER`: Only isolate the peer the pod needs to communicate with.

`// this will only create an egress policy on the 'web' pod.
web.connections.allowTo(redis, { isolation: PodConnectionsIsolation.POD });

// this will only create an ingress policy on the 'redis' pod.
web.connections.allowTo(redis, { isolation: PodConnectionsIsolation.PEER });

# PersistentVolume[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pv/#persistentvolume "Permanent link")

A `PersistentVolume` (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#persistent-volume)

PV’s are used by pods via the pod’s `volumes` spec, just like regular [volumes](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/volume/). They are not intended to be interchangable with volumes, you can think of a `PersistentVolume`as a specific type of volume, that is detached from a pod’s lifecycle, and exist even if the pod is shutdown.

The `PersistentVolume` construct represents a pre-existing volume in the cluster.

## Types[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pv/#types "Permanent link")

Each type is implmented as its own construct, exposing both common properties as well as type specific ones. Currently the supported types are:

* `AwsElasticBlockStorePersistentVolume`
* `AzureDiskPersistentVolume`
* `GCEPersistentDiskPersistentVolume`

For example, to create a PV from an existing AWS EBS volume:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';

const vol = new kplus.AwsElasticBlockStorePersistentVolume(chart, 'Volume', {
  // must exist in aws
  volumeId: 'vol1234',

  // assign the volume to small-ebs storage class
  storageClassName: 'small-ebs',

  // what is the volume storage
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
});
`

Note that this **does not** actually create a new volume, it merely manifests an existing volume in AWS as a Kubernetes resource.

## Reserve[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pv/#reserve "Permanent link")

> See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reserving-a-persistentvolume

Once the PV is defined, you can reserve it:

`const claim = vol.reserve();
`

This method creates a new `PersistentVolumeClaim` and performs a bi-directional binding that reserves the volume for usage. You can use the claim to mount a volume onto a container like usual:

`container.mount('/data', kplus.Volume.fromPersistentVolumeClaim(claim));
`

You can also directly mount a persistent volume, which will implicitly reserve it and create a volume from the created claim:

`const vol = new kplus.AwsElasticBlockStorePersistentVolume(chart, 'Volume', { volumeId: 'vol1234' });
container.mount('/data', vol);
`

## Bind[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pv/#bind "Permanent link")

Binding is a part of the reservation process, but it only creates a one directional link. You can use it to bind a PV to an existing PVC. Note however that if the PVC is not bound to the PV, there’s no guarantee this volume will indeed be given that specific claim.

`const claim = kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim.fromClaimName('claim');

// will modify the vol resource to refer to the claim.
// but no the other way around.
vol.bind(claim);
`

# PersistentVolumeClaim[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pvc/#persistentvolumeclaim "Permanent link")

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) is a request for storage by a pod.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#persistent-volume-claim)

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` contains the requirements of the request, and the Kubernetes control plane is responsible providing a physical volume that satisfies the claim’s requirements.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';

const pod = new kplus.Pod(chart, 'Pod');
const container = pod.addContainer({ image: 'node' });

// create the storage request
const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
});

// mount a volume based on the request to the container
// this will also add the volume itself to the pod spec.
container.mount('/data', kplus.Volume.fromPersistentVolumeClaim(claim));
`

## Storage Class[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pvc/#storage-class "Permanent link")

By default, the `storageClassName` property of a claim is not set. This means that the backing volume can be provided by one of two methods:

1. Dynamically provision a volume with the default storage class.
2. If a default storage class is not configured in the cluster, the backing volume must pre-exist and not be assigned to any storage class.

> See [Provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#provisioning) for more details.

You can also provide an explicit storage class name,

`const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
  storageClassName: 'large-ebs',
});
`

In this case, Kubernetes control plane will either locate an existing volume with the `larg-ebs` storage class, or dynamically provision a new using the appropriate provisioner.

You can also pass in a special `""` value, this means the volume must not be assigned to any storage class. Since all dynamically provisioend volumes belong to a storage class, setting this value effectively disables dynamic provisioning for this claim.

`const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
  // disable dynamic provisioning
  storageClassName: "",
});
`

## Bind[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/pvc/#bind "Permanent link")

Binding is a part of the reservation process, but it only creates a one directional link. You can use it to bind a PVC to an existing PV. Note however that if the PV is not bound to the PVC, there’s no guarantee this claim will indeed be given to that specific volume.

`const claim = new kplus.PersistentVolumeClaim(chart, 'Claim', {
  storage: cdk8s.Size.gibibytes(50),
});

const vol = kplus.PersistentVolume.fromPersistentVolumeName('vol');

// will modify the claim resource to refer to the volume.
// but no the other way around.
claim.bind(vol);

# Role Based Access Control[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/rbac/#role-based-access-control "Permanent link")

Role Based Access Control(RBAC) helps you restrict actions that can be performed on specific Kubernetes resources. To make this possible, RBAC lets you create roles with rules which define access permissions for your specified resource.

These roles can then be binded to Kubernetes subjects, which could be User, Group or ServiceAccount.

Note

Rules or permissions are purely additive and there are no deny rules.

Now, there are two types of roles available, \* Role: These set permissions within a particular namespace i.e. is for namespaced resources, like, pods, deployments. \* ClusterRole: These set permissions for non-namespaced resources, like, nodes, urls.

and, similarly there are two types of binding available, \* RoleBinding: These grant permissions within a specific namespace. \* ClusterRoleBinding: These grant cluster wide permissions .

const group = kplus.Group.fromName(this, 'SampleGroup', 'sample-group');
const serviceAccount = new kplus.ServiceAccount(this, 'SampleServiceAccount');

// You can bind this cluster role to a specific user, group or service account
clusterRole.bind(user, group, serviceAccount);
`

## Resource Permission Methods[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/rbac/#resource-permission-methods "Permanent link")

You can use convenience methods like `grantRead` and `grantReadWrite` which would make it easier to grant list of subjects set of permissions for the resource.

### `grantReadWrite` Method[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/rbac/#grantreadwrite-method "Permanent link")

`// Creating a Pod resource
const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod', {
    containers: [{ image: 'image' }],
});

const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
const group = kplus.Group.fromName(this, 'SampleGroup', 'sample-group');
const serviceAccount = new kplus.ServiceAccount(this, 'SampleServiceAccount');

// You can grant permissions to specific user, group or service account.
pod.permissions.grantReadWrite(user, group, serviceAccount);
`

## Add subjects to an already bound role[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/rbac/#add-subjects-to-an-already-bound-role "Permanent link")

`const user = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'SampleUser', 'Jane');
const binding = role.bind(user);

const anotherUser = kplus.User.fromName(this, 'AnotherSampleUser', 'James');
binding.addSubjects(anotherUser);

# Secret[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/secret/#secret "Permanent link")

Secrets are used to store confidential information. Never store such information on the definition of the pod itself.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#secret)

## Use an existing `Secret`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/secret/#use-an-existing-secret "Permanent link")

To reference a secret created outside of your deployment definition, use the following. Note that this does not create a new object, and will therefore not be included in the resulting manifest.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const secret = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName('aws-creds');
`

## Adding data[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/secret/#adding-data "Permanent link")

To create a new secret with some data, use:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const secret = new kplus.Secret(chart, 'Secret');
secret.addStringData('password', 'some-encrypted-data');
`

# ServiceAccount[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/service-account/#serviceaccount "Permanent link")

Use service accounts to provide an identity for pods.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#serviceaccount)

## Use an existing `ServiceAccount`[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/service-account/#use-an-existing-serviceaccount "Permanent link")

To reference a service account created outside of your deployment definition, use the following. Note that this does not create a new object, and will therefore not be included in the resulting manifest.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const serviceAccount = kplus.ServiceAccount.fromServiceAccountName('aws-service');
`

## Allowing access to secrets[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/service-account/#allowing-access-to-secrets "Permanent link")

To create a new service account, and give it access to some secrets, use the following:

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';
import * as k from 'cdk8s';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');

const awsCreds = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName('aws-creds');
const awsService = new kplus.ServiceAccount(chart, 'AWS');

// give access to the aws creds secret.
awsService.addSecret(awsCreds);
`

# Service[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/service/#service "Permanent link")

Use services when you want to expose a set of pods using a stable network identity. They can also be used for externalizing endpoints to clients outside of the kubernetes cluster.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#service)

## Selectors[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/service/#selectors "Permanent link")

Services must be configured with selectors that tell it which pods should it serve. The most common selector method is using labels.

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');
const frontends = new kplus.Service(chart, 'FrontEnds');

// this will cause the service to select all pods with the 'run: frontend' label.
frontends.select(kplus.LabelSelector.equals('run', 'frontend'));
`

## Ports[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/service/#ports "Permanent link")

Ports that the service will listen and redirect to can be configured like so:

`import * as k from 'cdk8s';
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const app = new k.App();
const chart = new k.Chart(app, 'Chart');
const frontends = new kplus.Service(chart, 'FrontEnds');

// make the service bind to port 9000 and redirect to port 80 on the associated containers.
frontends.bind({port: 9000, targetPort: 80)

# Volume[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/volume/#volume "Permanent link")

Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod.

[API Reference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-31/typescript/#volume)

## Create from a ConfigMap[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/volume/#create-from-a-configmap "Permanent link")

A very useful operation is to create a volume from a `ConfigMap`. Kubernetes will translate every key in the config map to a file, who’s content is the value of the key.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const configMap = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName('redis-config');
const configVolume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(configMap);
`

## Create from an EmptyDir[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus/cdk8s-plus-31/volume/#create-from-an-emptydir "Permanent link")

The easiest way to allocate some persistent storage to your container is to create a volume from an empty directory. This volume, as the name suggests, is initially empty, and can be written to by containers who mount it. The data in the volume is preserved throughout the lifecycle of the pod, but is deleted forever as soon as the pod itself is removed.

`import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-31';

const data = kplus.Volume.fromEmptyDir(configMap);

const pod = new kplus.Pod(this, 'Pod');
const redis = pod.addContainer({
  image: 'redis'
})

// mount to the redis container.
redis.mount('/var/lib/redis', data);

# import[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#import "Permanent link")

The `import` command generates low-level (L1) constructs for Kubernetes API objects and Custom Resources (CRDs).

## General Options[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#general-options "Permanent link")

### Target programming language (`--language`)[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#target-programming-language-language "Permanent link")

You can specify your desired language with the `--language` flag. For example:

CLI:

`cdk8s import --language typescript
`

`cdk8s.yaml`:

`language: typescript
`

### Output directory (`--output`)[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#output-directory-output "Permanent link")

The `--output` (or `-o`) option can be used to specify the output directory for your imports.

### Class name prefix (`--class-prefix`)[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#class-name-prefix-class-prefix "Permanent link")

For `k8s` imports, all imported classes will have a `Kube` prefix to denote that those are core Kubernetes APIs. For CRD imports, the class name will match the resource kind.

You can use the `--class-prefix` option to specify an alternative prefix or`--no-class-prefix` to disable this behavior for `k8s` imports.

### Module name[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#module-name "Permanent link")

You can also override the default behavior for `cdk8s` importing. This will be helpful to you if you would like to name your CRD imports differently from their kind. Here is how you do it:

CLI:

`cdk8s import example:=my_crd.yaml
`

`cdk8s.yaml`:

`imports:
  - example:=my_crd.yaml
`

If your CRD contained two kinds, `Cluster` and `Autoscaler`, you would have two imports. You could use them in this fashion:

[Typescript](#%5F%5Ftabbed%5F1%5F1)[Python](#%5F%5Ftabbed%5F1%5F2)

`import { Cluster } from './imports/example-cluster';
import { Autoscaler } from './imports/example-autoscaler';
`

`not yet supported
`

## Import Types[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#import-types "Permanent link")

The `import` command supports two types of imports:

1. `k8s`: generates constructs from the core Kubernetes API
2. `CRDs`: generates constructs from custom resource definitions
3. `Helm Charts`: generates constructs from helm charts.

This section describes specific behavior related to each type of import.

### Kubernetes APIs[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#kubernetes-apis "Permanent link")

To generate constructs for all Kubernetes API objects of a certain version, use:

`cdk8s import k8s
`

The `import` command will generate files under an “imports” directory inside your project with constructs for each API object in the Kubernetes spec.

Tip

It is recommended to _commit_ these generated files into your source control.

By default, generated class names will be named `KubeXyz` where `Xyz` is the API object kind (e.g. `KubeDeployment`).

#### Kubernetes Versions[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#kubernetes-versions "Permanent link")

Use the `@version` notation to import a specific Kubernetes version:

`cdk8s import k8s@1.16.0
`

Alternatively, you can specify your `k8s` import in the `cdk8s.yaml` config file:

`imports:
  - k8s@1.17.0
`

#### API Object Versions[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#api-object-versions "Permanent link")

When importing the core Kubernetes API objects, `cdk8s import` will generate constructs both for stable APIs (e.g. `v1`) and pre-stable APIs (`v1beta1`). To ensure compatibility across Kubernetes versions, construct classes generated for non-stable resources will include a postfix with the API level.

For example, the import for `k8s@1.18` includes `KubeIngressV1Beta1` as the only `Ingress`resource. This is because `Ingress` has not been stabilized yet. The import for `k8s@1.19`will also include an `Ingress` construct which represents the `v1` resource.

### CRDs[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#crds "Permanent link")

You can import CRDs from local files or URLs:

`cdk8s import my_crd.yaml
`

Or from `cdk8s.yaml`:

`imports:
  - my_crd.yaml
`

A CRD with group `mygroup.io` and kind `Foo` will be imported to the following locations:

* TypeScript: `imports/mygroup.io.ts`
* Python: `imports/mygroup/io`

#### Importing CRDs from a cluster[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#importing-crds-from-a-cluster "Permanent link")

If the imported YAML is a `List` of CRDs, all these CRDs will be imported. This is useful, for example, to import all the CRDs from a running cluster:

`kubectl get crds -o json | cdk8s import /dev/stdin
`

> Yes, this works!

### Helm Charts[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#helm-charts "Permanent link")

You can import a helm chart and code generate a dedicated construct for it. To do this, pass either a url or a local path to the helm chart. For example, running the following command would code generate [bitnami’s mysql](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/mysql) helm chart:

`cdk8s import helm:https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami/mysql@9.10.10
`

> The format for the helm chart url is: `helm:<repo-url>/<chart-name>@<chart-version>`.

You can use this generated construct in your cdk8s application,

`import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';
import { Mysql, MysqlArchitecture } from './imports/mysql';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new Mysql(this, 'MySql', {
      values: {
        architecture: MysqlArchitecture.STANDALONE,     // <------- type safe property
      }
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'Typescript-App');
app.synth();
`

Note

You would need `helm` to be installed on your machine for using this feature. For accessing private helm repositories, you must be authenticated to the repository in a way that the `helm pull` command recognizes.

This feature is an extension to [helm](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/basics/helm/) support in cdk8s and you will find similar properties of Helm construct in these generated constructs.

#### Values Schema[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#values-schema "Permanent link")

If the helm chart that you are importing contains a schema file (`values.schema.json`) within it, then the `values` property of the construct properties will be typed according to that schema.

For example:

`` import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';
import { Mysql, MysqlArchitecture } from './imports/mysql';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new Mysql(this, 'MySql', {
      values: {
        architecture: 'foo',    // <------- This will give an error since this is not `MysqlArchitecture` type which is generated from Schema
      }
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'Typescript-App');
app.synth();
 ``

If there is no schema present in the helm chart, then `values` will not have type support and you can pass in any values. 

#### Additional Values and Globals[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#additional-values-and-globals "Permanent link")

The generated construct’s `values` property will also include following special properties:

* `additionalValues`: If the imported helm chart has a schema but that schema does not cover all values accepted by the chart, then you can use this property to pass in those values to the chart.
* `global`: This property can be used to set global values. For more information, see [here](https://helm.sh/docs/chart%5Ftemplate%5Fguide/subcharts%5Fand%5Fglobals/#global-chart-values).

For example:

`import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';
import { Mysql, MysqlArchitecture } from './imports/mysql';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new Mysql(this, 'MySql', {
      values: {
        architecture: MysqlArchitecture.STANDALONE,
        global: {                                   // <------- global values
          imageRegistry: 'bar',
        },
        additionalValues: {                         // <------- values missing in schema which are not code generated
          nameOverride: "baz"
        },
      }
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'Typescript-App');
app.synth();
`

#### Dependencies[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/#dependencies "Permanent link")

If the imported helm chart has any dependencies mentioned in `Chart.yaml`, then you will find those as properties in the generated construct. You can use those to pass in values to the dependency. 

`` import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';
import { Mysql, MysqlArchitecture } from './imports/mysql';

export class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new Mysql(this, 'MySql', {
      values: {
        architecture: MysqlArchitecture.STANDALONE,
        common: {                                   // <------- `common` is a dependency for the MySql helm chart
          names: {
            namespace: 'foo',
          }
        },
      }
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyChart(app, 'Typescript-App');
app.synth();

# synth[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/#synth "Permanent link")

The `cdk8s synth` command is a convenience command which will simply execute the application defined in `cdk8s.yaml` under `app`.

For example, if your `cdk8s.yaml` file looks like this:

`app: node app.js
`

Then, `cdk8s synth` will execute `node app.js`.

## Configuring synth output[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/#configuring-synth-output "Permanent link")

The properties of the synthesized YAML from `cdk8s synth` can be modified by the properties of the `App` construct. Things like file extensions, how API objects are distributed between files, and the output directory can all be configured in your [AppProps](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/blob/2.x/docs/typescript.md#appprops-)

For example:

`const app = new App({
  // Instead of the default "dist"
  outdir: "output",
  // Instead of ".k8s.yaml"
  outputFileExtension: ".generated.yaml",
  // Divide every resource into its own file, instead of grouping by Chart
  yamlOutputType: YamlOutputType.FILE_PER_RESOURCE,
});
`

## Validating Manifests[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/#validating-manifests "Permanent link")

You can perform validation on the manifests produced by cdk8s by configuring third-party validation plugins. To do so, use the `validations` property in the `cdk8s.yaml` configuration file:

`language: typescript
app: ts-node main.ts
validations:
  - package: '@datreeio/datree-cdk8s'
    class: DatreeValidation
    version: 1.3.4
`

With this configuration, `cdk8s` will dynamically install the `@datreeio/datree-cdk8s` package from NPM during synthesis, and produce a violation report. For example:

`` Validation Report (@datreeio/datree-cdk8s@1.3.4)
------------------------------------------------

(Summary)

╔═══════════╤════════════════════════╗
║ Status    │ failure                ║

(Violations)

Ensure each container image has a pinned (tag) version (2 occurrences)

  Occurrences:

    - Construct Path: cdk8s-app/Web/Resource
    - Manifest Path: ./dist/cdk8s-app.k8s.yaml
    - Resource Name: cdk8s-app-web-c825557e
    - Locations:
      > spec/template/spec/containers/0/image (line: 31:18)

    - Construct Path: cdk8s-app/Cache/Resource
    - Manifest Path: ./dist/cdk8s-app.k8s.yaml
    - Resource Name: cdk8s-app-cache-c8fee821
    - Locations:
      > spec/template/spec/containers/0/image (line: 112:18)

  Recommendation: Incorrect value for key `image` - specify an image version to avoid unpleasant "version surprises" in the future
  How to fix: https://hub.datree.io/ensure-image-pinned-version

Validation failed. See above reports for details
 ``

If the report resulted in a failure, the `cdk8s synth` command will fail. You can also put the contents of the `validation` property into a separate file (either remote or local), and refer to it:

`language: typescript
app: ts-node main.ts
validations: http://path/to/validations.yaml
`

### Private Validation Plugins[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/#private-validation-plugins "Permanent link")

To use a validation plugin that is hosted in a private NPM registry, use the `installEnv`property to specify a custom registry:

`language: typescript
app: ts-node main.ts
validations:
  - package: my-private-plugin
    class: MyValidation
    version: 0.0.1
    installEnv:
      npm_config_registry: http://my/custom/registry
`

> All key value pairs in the `installEnv` property will be passed as is to the `npm` command that `cdk8s`executes when it installs your plugin.

### Pre-Installing Plugins[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/#pre-installing-plugins "Permanent link")

You can prevent `cdk8s` from contacting NPM during synthesis by providing it with the necessary plugins. Plugins are stored in the `~/.cdk8s/plugins` directory, and `cdk8s` will first check if a plugin is already installed before trying to install it.

If you pre-populate the plugins directory correctly, you can prevent `cdk8s` from contacting NPM. This can be useful for air-gapped synthesis scenarios for example.

Here is how `cdk8s` expects the directory to be structured, assuming the plugin package is called `plugin1`, and its version is `0.0.1`

`~/.cdk8s/plugins/plugin1/0.0.1/node_modules/plugin1/package.json`

You can achieve this structure by running the following commands:

`mkdir -p ~/.cdk8s/plugins/plugin1/0.0.1/node_modules/plugin1
npm install --prefix ~/.cdk8s/plugins/plugin1/0.0.1/node_modules/plugin1 plugin1@0.0.1
`

You can also control the plugins storage directory by one of:

* `--plugins-dir` in the `cdk8s synth` command.
* `CDK8S_PLUGINS_DIR` environment variable.
* `pluginsDirectory` key in the `cdk8s.yaml` configuration file.

### Available Plugins[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/#available-plugins "Permanent link")

* [Datree](https://github.com/datreeio/datree-cdk8s)

### Writing Plugins[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/#writing-plugins "Permanent link")

See [cdk8s-validation-plugin-example](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-validation-plugin-example)

## Helm Synthesis[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/synth/#helm-synthesis "Permanent link")

You can synthesize your cdk8s application to a format that is compatible with [helm](https://helm.sh/). 

For example, you can run:

`cdk8s synth --format helm --chart-version 1.0.0
`

Then it will synthesize a generated helm chart to the output folder (default is ‘dist’). The `--chart-version` will be the [version](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#charts-and-versioning) of the helm chart and must follow [SemVer2](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) standards. The synthesized manifests will be placed in `templates/` folder. And, if any crds were mentioned in `cdk8s.yaml` config file as `imports`, then they will be downloaded and placed in the `crds/` folder. 

The folder structure will look like:

`dist/              
├── Chart.yaml
├── README.md
├── crds/
└── templates/
`

Note

CRDs are not supported when `--chart-api-version` is set to `v1`. 

You can use the synthesized chart to deploy using helm:

`cdk8s synth --format helm --chart-version 1.0.0 && helm install <release-name> ./dist
`

Note

Templates within the generated Helm chart are pure and static Kubernetes manifests; they don’t contain any helm template directives. This means they cannot be customized with a values.yaml file or the release name. One important implication of this is that you cannot deploy two different releases of the same chart, as resource names will collide. If you need customization, you can do this within the cdk8s application (for example by explicitly reading a values.yaml file).

##### `generateObjectName` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#generateobjectname "Permanent link")

`public generateObjectName(apiObject: ApiObject): string
`

Generates a app-unique name for an object given it’s construct node path.

Different resource types may have different constraints on names (`metadata.name`). The previous version of the name generator was compatible with DNS\_SUBDOMAIN but not with DNS\_LABEL.

For example, `Deployment` names must comply with DNS\_SUBDOMAIN while`Service` names must comply with DNS\_LABEL.

Since there is no formal specification for this, the default name generation scheme for kubernetes objects in cdk8s was changed to DNS\_LABEL, since it’s the common denominator for all kubernetes resources (supposedly).

You can override this method if you wish to customize object names at the chart level.

* _Type:_ {\[ key: string \]: string}

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.

They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.

##### `finalizers`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#finalizersoptional "Permanent link")

`public readonly finalizers: string[];
`

* _Type:_ string\[\]
* _Default:_ No finalizers.

Namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion.

Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

`public readonly labels: {[ key: string ]: string};
`

* _Type:_ {\[ key: string \]: string}
* _Default:_ No labels.

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.

May match selectors of replication controllers and services.

---

##### `name`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#nameoptional "Permanent link")

`public readonly name: string;
`

* _Type:_ string
* _Default:_ an app-unique name generated by the chart

The unique, namespace-global, name of this object inside the Kubernetes cluster.

Normally, you shouldn’t specify names for objects and let the CDK generate a name for you that is application-unique. The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness.

You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the`chart.generateObjectName` method.

If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won’t be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified.

##### `namespace`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#namespaceoptional%5F1 "Permanent link")

`public readonly namespace: string;
`

* _Type:_ string
* _Default:_ undefined (will be assigned to the ‘default’ namespace)

Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique.

An empty namespace is equivalent to the “default” namespace, but “default” is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS\_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

##### `ownerReferences`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#ownerreferencesoptional "Permanent link")

`public readonly ownerReferences: OwnerReference[];
`

* _Type:_ [OwnerReference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#cdk8s.OwnerReference)\[\]
* _Default:_ automatically set by Kubernetes

List of objects depended by this object.

If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field. However, you usually don’t need to and can allow Kubernetes to automatically manage the relationships.

If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field. However, you usually don’t need to and can allow Kubernetes to automatically manage the relationships.

### DependencyGraph [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/typescript/#dependencygraph "Permanent link")

Represents the dependency graph for a given Node.

This graph includes the dependency relationships between all nodes in the node (construct) sub-tree who’s root is this Node.

Note that this means that lonely nodes (no dependencies and no dependants) are also included in this graph as childless children of the root node of the graph.

The graph does not include cross-scope dependencies. That is, if a child on the current scope depends on a node from a different scope, that relationship is not represented in this graph.

* _Type:_ str
* _Default:_ CDK8S\_OUTDIR if defined, otherwise “dist”

The directory to output Kubernetes manifests.

If you synthesize your application using `cdk8s synth`, you must also pass this value to the CLI using the `--output` option or the `output` property in the `cdk8s.yaml` configuration file. Otherwise, the CLI will not know about the output directory, and synthesis will fail.

This property is intended for internal and testing use.

* _Default:_ no resolvers.

A list of resolvers that can be used to replace property values before they are written to the manifest file.

When multiple resolvers are passed, they are invoked by order in the list, and only the first one that applies (e.g calls `context.replaceValue`) is invoked.

##### `generate_object_name` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#generate%5Fobject%5Fname "Permanent link")

`def generate_object_name(
  api_object: ApiObject
) -> str
`

Generates a app-unique name for an object given it’s construct node path.

Different resource types may have different constraints on names (`metadata.name`). The previous version of the name generator was compatible with DNS\_SUBDOMAIN but not with DNS\_LABEL.

For example, `Deployment` names must comply with DNS\_SUBDOMAIN while`Service` names must comply with DNS\_LABEL.

Since there is no formal specification for this, the default name generation scheme for kubernetes objects in cdk8s was changed to DNS\_LABEL, since it’s the common denominator for all kubernetes resources (supposedly).

You can override this method if you wish to customize object names at the chart level.

##### `annotations`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#annotationsoptional "Permanent link")

`annotations: typing.Mapping[str]
`

* _Type:_ typing.Mapping\[str\]
* _Default:_ No annotations.

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.

They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.

> <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations>

---

##### `finalizers`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#finalizersoptional "Permanent link")

`finalizers: typing.List[str]
`

* _Type:_ typing.List\[str\]
* _Default:_ No finalizers.

Namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion.

Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

##### `labels`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#labelsoptional%5F1 "Permanent link")

`labels: typing.Mapping[str]
`

* _Type:_ typing.Mapping\[str\]
* _Default:_ No labels.

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.

May match selectors of replication controllers and services.

> <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels>

---

##### `name`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#nameoptional "Permanent link")

`name: str
`

* _Type:_ str
* _Default:_ an app-unique name generated by the chart

The unique, namespace-global, name of this object inside the Kubernetes cluster.

Normally, you shouldn’t specify names for objects and let the CDK generate a name for you that is application-unique. The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness.

You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the`chart.generateObjectName` method.

If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won’t be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified.

---

##### `namespace`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#namespaceoptional%5F3 "Permanent link")

`namespace: str
`

* _Type:_ str
* _Default:_ undefined (will be assigned to the ‘default’ namespace)

Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique.

An empty namespace is equivalent to the “default” namespace, but “default” is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS\_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

---

##### `owner_references`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#owner%5Freferencesoptional "Permanent link")

`owner_references: typing.List[OwnerReference]
`

* _Type:_ typing.List\[[OwnerReference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#cdk8s.OwnerReference)\]
* _Default:_ automatically set by Kubernetes

List of objects depended by this object.

If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field. However, you usually don’t need to and can allow Kubernetes to automatically manage the relationships.

`outdir: str
`

* _Type:_ str
* _Default:_ CDK8S\_OUTDIR if defined, otherwise “dist”

The directory to output Kubernetes manifests.

If you synthesize your application using `cdk8s synth`, you must also pass this value to the CLI using the `--output` option or the `output` property in the `cdk8s.yaml` configuration file. Otherwise, the CLI will not know about the output directory, and synthesis will fail.

This property is intended for internal and testing use.

* _Default:_ no resolvers.

A list of resolvers that can be used to replace property values before they are written to the manifest file.

When multiple resolvers are passed, they are invoked by order in the list, and only the first one that applies (e.g calls `context.replaceValue`) is invoked.

### OwnerReference [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#ownerreference "Permanent link")

OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object.

An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.

##### `annotations`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#annotationsoptional%5F2 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ typing.Mapping\[str\]
* _Default:_ No annotations.

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.

They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.

> <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations>

---

##### `finalizers`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#finalizersoptional%5F2 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ typing.List\[str\]
* _Default:_ No finalizers.

Namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion.

Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

---

##### `labels`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#labelsoptional%5F4 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ typing.Mapping\[str\]
* _Default:_ No labels.

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.

May match selectors of replication controllers and services.

> <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels>

---

##### `name`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#nameoptional%5F2 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ str
* _Default:_ an app-unique name generated by the chart

The unique, namespace-global, name of this object inside the Kubernetes cluster.

Normally, you shouldn’t specify names for objects and let the CDK generate a name for you that is application-unique. The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness.

You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the`chart.generateObjectName` method.

If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won’t be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified.

---

##### `namespace`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#namespaceoptional%5F7 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ str
* _Default:_ undefined (will be assigned to the ‘default’ namespace)

Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique.

An empty namespace is equivalent to the “default” namespace, but “default” is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS\_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

---

##### `owner_references`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#owner%5Freferencesoptional%5F2 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ typing.List\[[OwnerReference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#cdk8s.OwnerReference)\]
* _Default:_ automatically set by Kubernetes

List of objects depended by this object.

If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field. However, you usually don’t need to and can allow Kubernetes to automatically manage the relationships.

##### `api_object`Required [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#api%5Fobjectrequired%5F2 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ [ApiObject](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/python/#cdk8s.ApiObject)

Which ApiObject instance is the metadata attached to.

* _Default:_ CDK8S\_OUTDIR if defined, otherwise “dist”

The directory to output Kubernetes manifests.

If you synthesize your application using `cdk8s synth`, you must also pass this value to the CLI using the `--output` option or the `output` property in the `cdk8s.yaml` configuration file. Otherwise, the CLI will not know about the output directory, and synthesis will fail.

This property is intended for internal and testing use.

---

##### `generateObjectName` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#generateobjectname "Permanent link")

`public java.lang.String generateObjectName(ApiObject apiObject)
`

Generates a app-unique name for an object given it’s construct node path.

Different resource types may have different constraints on names (`metadata.name`). The previous version of the name generator was compatible with DNS\_SUBDOMAIN but not with DNS\_LABEL.

For example, `Deployment` names must comply with DNS\_SUBDOMAIN while`Service` names must comply with DNS\_LABEL.

Since there is no formal specification for this, the default name generation scheme for kubernetes objects in cdk8s was changed to DNS\_LABEL, since it’s the common denominator for all kubernetes resources (supposedly).

You can override this method if you wish to customize object names at the chart level.

* _Type:_ java.util.Map<java.lang.string, java.lang.string=""></java.lang.string,>
* _Default:_ No annotations.

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.

They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.

##### `finalizers`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#finalizersoptional "Permanent link")

`public java.util.List<java.lang.String> getFinalizers();
`

* _Type:_ java.util.List
* _Default:_ No finalizers.

Namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion.

Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

`public java.util.Map<java.lang.String, java.lang.String> getLabels();
`

* _Type:_ java.util.Map<java.lang.string, java.lang.string=""></java.lang.string,>
* _Default:_ No labels.

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.

May match selectors of replication controllers and services.

##### `name`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#nameoptional "Permanent link")

`public java.lang.String getName();
`

* _Type:_ java.lang.String
* _Default:_ an app-unique name generated by the chart

The unique, namespace-global, name of this object inside the Kubernetes cluster.

Normally, you shouldn’t specify names for objects and let the CDK generate a name for you that is application-unique. The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness.

You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the`chart.generateObjectName` method.

If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won’t be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified.

##### `namespace`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#namespaceoptional%5F3 "Permanent link")

`public java.lang.String getNamespace();
`

* _Type:_ java.lang.String
* _Default:_ undefined (will be assigned to the ‘default’ namespace)

Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique.

An empty namespace is equivalent to the “default” namespace, but “default” is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS\_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

##### `ownerReferences`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#ownerreferencesoptional "Permanent link")

`public java.util.List<OwnerReference> getOwnerReferences();
`

* _Type:_ java.util.List<[OwnerReference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#cdk8s.OwnerReference)\>
* _Default:_ automatically set by Kubernetes

List of objects depended by this object.

If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field. However, you usually don’t need to and can allow Kubernetes to automatically manage the relationships.

##### `annotations`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#annotationsoptional%5F2 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ java.util.Map<java.lang.string, java.lang.string=""></java.lang.string,>
* _Default:_ No annotations.

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.

They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.

##### `finalizers`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#finalizersoptional%5F2 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ java.util.List
* _Default:_ No finalizers.

Namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion.

Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

##### `labels`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#labelsoptional%5F4 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ java.util.Map<java.lang.string, java.lang.string=""></java.lang.string,>
* _Default:_ No labels.

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.

May match selectors of replication controllers and services.

> <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels>

---

##### `name`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#nameoptional%5F2 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ java.lang.String
* _Default:_ an app-unique name generated by the chart

The unique, namespace-global, name of this object inside the Kubernetes cluster.

Normally, you shouldn’t specify names for objects and let the CDK generate a name for you that is application-unique. The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness.

You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the`chart.generateObjectName` method.

If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won’t be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified.

---

##### `namespace`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#namespaceoptional%5F7 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ java.lang.String
* _Default:_ undefined (will be assigned to the ‘default’ namespace)

Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique.

An empty namespace is equivalent to the “default” namespace, but “default” is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS\_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

---

##### `ownerReferences`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#ownerreferencesoptional%5F2 "Permanent link")

* _Type:_ java.util.List<[OwnerReference](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#cdk8s.OwnerReference)\>
* _Default:_ automatically set by Kubernetes

List of objects depended by this object.

If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field. However, you usually don’t need to and can allow Kubernetes to automatically manage the relationships.

##### `apiObject`Required [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s/java/#apiobjectrequired%5F2 "Permanent link")

### DaemonSet [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#daemonset "Permanent link")

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod.

As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

* running a cluster storage daemon on every node
* running a logs collection daemon on every node
* running a node monitoring daemon on every node

In a simple case, one DaemonSet, covering all nodes, would be used for each type of daemon. A more complex setup might use multiple DaemonSets for a single type of daemon, but with different flags and/or different memory and cpu requests for different hardware types.

#### Initializers [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#initializers%5F8 "Permanent link")

### Deployment [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#deployment "Permanent link")

* _Implements:_ [cdk8s-plus-29.IScalable](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cdk8s-plus-29.IScalable)

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

> Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below.

Use Case

The following are typical use cases for Deployments:

* Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not.
* Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment.
* Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment.
* Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load.
* Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout.
* Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.
* Clean up older ReplicaSets that you don’t need anymore.

### HorizontalPodAutoscaler [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#horizontalpodautoscaler "Permanent link")

A HorizontalPodAutoscaler scales a workload up or down in response to a metric change.

This allows your services to scale up when demand is high and scale down when they are no longer needed.

Typical use cases for HorizontalPodAutoscaler:

* When Memory usage is above 70%, scale up the number of replicas to meet the demand.
* When CPU usage is below 30%, scale down the number of replicas to save resources.
* When a service is experiencing a spike in traffic, scale up the number of replicas to meet the demand. Then, when the traffic subsides, scale down the number of replicas to save resources.

The autoscaler uses the following algorithm to determine the number of replicas to scale:

`desiredReplicas = ceil[currentReplicas * ( currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue )]`

HorizontalPodAutoscaler’s can be used to with any `Scalable` workload: \* Deployment \* StatefulSet

**Targets that already have a replica count defined:**

Remove any replica counts from the target resource before associating with a HorizontalPodAutoscaler. If this isn’t done, then any time a change to that object is applied, Kubernetes will scale the current number of Pods to the value of the target.replicas key. This may not be desired and could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Job [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#job "Permanent link")

A Job creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate.

As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot). You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

In Kubernetes, namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespace-based scoping is applicable only for namespaced objects (e.g. Deployments, Services, etc) and not for cluster-wide objects (e.g. StorageClass, Nodes, PersistentVolumes, etc).

### NetworkPolicy [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#networkpolicy "Permanent link")

Control traffic flow at the IP address or port level (OSI layer 3 or 4), network policies are an application-centric construct which allow you to specify how a pod is allowed to communicate with various network peers.

Outgoing traffic is allowed if there are no network policies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic matches at least one egress rule across all of the network policies that select the pod.

* Incoming traffic is allowed to a pod if there are no network policies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic source is the pod’s local node, OR if the traffic matches at least one ingress rule across all of the network policies that select the pod.

Network policies do not conflict; they are additive. If any policy or policies apply to a given pod for a given direction, the connections allowed in that direction from that pod is the union of what the applicable policies allow. Thus, order of evaluation does not affect the policy result.

For a connection from a source pod to a destination pod to be allowed, both the egress policy on the source pod and the ingress policy on the destination pod need to allow the connection. If either side does not allow the connection, it will not happen.

A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.

It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual Pod that uses the PV. This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

### Service [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#service "Permanent link")

An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.

With Kubernetes you don’t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible—frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling.

If you’re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod.

When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster). Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default).

### StatefulSet [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#statefulset "Permanent link")

* _Implements:_ [cdk8s-plus-29.IScalable](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cdk8s-plus-29.IScalable)

StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.

Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed.

## Using StatefulSets[¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#using-statefulsets "Permanent link")

StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.

* Stable, unique network identifiers.

### Volume [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#volume "Permanent link")

* _Implements:_ [cdk8s-plus-29.IStorage](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cdk8s-plus-29.IStorage)

Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes).

A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously.

At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used.

To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers\[\*\].volumeMounts field).

A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes

Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers in a similar fashion.

Init containers cannot currently be added ,removed or updated.

A call to the PreStop hook fails if the container is already in a terminated or completed state and the hook must complete before the TERM signal to stop the container can be sent. The Pod’s termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hook is executed, so regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod’s termination grace period. No parameters are passed to the handler.

`

* _Type:_ [cdk8s.Duration](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cdk8s.Duration)
* _Default:_ Duration.seconds(10)

Kubernetes attempts to start cron jobs at its schedule time, but this is not guaranteed.

This deadline specifies how much time can pass after a schedule point, for which kubernetes can still start the job. For example, if this is set to 100 seconds, kubernetes is allowed to start the job at a maximum 100 seconds after the scheduled time.

Note that the Kubernetes CronJobController checks for things every 10 seconds, for this reason, a deadline below 10 seconds is not allowed, as it may cause your job to never be scheduled.

In addition, kubernetes will stop scheduling jobs if more than 100 schedules were missed (for any reason). This property also controls what time interval should kubernetes consider when counting for missed schedules.

For example, suppose a CronJob is set to schedule a new Job every one minute beginning at 08:30:00, and its `startingDeadline` field is not set. If the CronJob controller happens to be down from 08:29:00 to 10:21:00, the job will not start as the number of missed jobs which missed their schedule is greater than 100\. However, if `startingDeadline` is set to 200 seconds, kubernetes will only count 3 missed schedules, and thus start a new execution at 10:22:00.

Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986.

Note the following deviations from the “host” part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1\. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2\. The `:`delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue.

Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional “path” part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986\. Paths must begin with a ‘/’.

---

##### `pathType`Optional [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#pathtypeoptional%5F4 "Permanent link")

* _Default:_ If unspecified, it allows SSL routing based on SNI hostname.

Secret is the secret that contains the certificate and key used to terminate SSL traffic on 443.

If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the “Host” header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.

* _Type:_ [cdk8s-plus-29.Topology](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cdk8s-plus-29.Topology)

A region represents a larger domain, made up of one or more zones.

It is uncommon for Kubernetes clusters to span multiple regions. While the exact definition of a zone or region is left to infrastructure implementations, common properties of a region include higher network latency between them than within them, non-zero cost for network traffic between them, and failure independence from other zones or regions.

For example, nodes within a region might share power infrastructure (e.g. a UPS or generator), but nodes in different regions typically would not.

* _Type:_ [cdk8s-plus-29.Topology](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cdk8s-plus-29.Topology)

A zone represents a logical failure domain.

It is common for Kubernetes clusters to span multiple zones for increased availability. While the exact definition of a zone is left to infrastructure implementations, common properties of a zone include very low network latency within a zone, no-cost network traffic within a zone, and failure independence from other zones. For example, nodes within a zone might share a network switch, but nodes in different zones should not.

### ContainerRestartPolicy [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#containerrestartpolicy "Permanent link")

RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.

This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is “Always”. For non-init containers or when this field is not specified, the restart behavior is defined by the Pod’s restart policy and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as “Always” for the init container will have the following effect: this init container will be continually restarted on exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy “Always” will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and is often referred to as a “sidecar” container.

> https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/

#### `ALWAYS` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#always "Permanent link")

If an init container is created with its restartPolicy set to Always, it will start and remain running during the entire life of the Pod.

For regular containers, this is ignored by Kubernetes.

---

---

#### `CLUSTER_FIRST_WITH_HOST_NET` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cluster%5Ffirst%5Fwith%5Fhost%5Fnet "Permanent link")

For Pods running with hostNetwork, you should explicitly set its DNS policy “ClusterFirstWithHostNet”.

---

#### `DEFAULT` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#default "Permanent link")

The Pod inherits the name resolution configuration from the node that the pods run on.

---

#### `NONE` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#none%5F1 "Permanent link")

It allows a Pod to ignore DNS settings from the Kubernetes environment.

### ImagePullPolicy [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#imagepullpolicy "Permanent link")

#### `ALWAYS` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#always%5F2 "Permanent link")

Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest.

If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container.

Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted.

---

#### `IF_NOT_PRESENT` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#if%5Fnot%5Fpresent "Permanent link")

The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally.

Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest

---

#### `NEVER` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#never "Permanent link")

The image is assumed to exist locally.

No attempt is made to pull the image.

---

### MountPropagation [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#mountpropagation "Permanent link")

#### `NONE` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#none%5F2 "Permanent link")

This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host.

In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host.

This is the default mode.

This mode is equal to `private` mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation

---

#### `HOST_TO_CONTAINER` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#host%5Fto%5Fcontainer "Permanent link")

This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories.

In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there.

Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it.

This mode is equal to `rslave` mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation

---

#### `BIDIRECTIONAL` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#bidirectional "Permanent link")

This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount.

In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume

A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume.

This mode is equal to `rshared` mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation

Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination.

---

### NetworkPolicyTrafficDefault [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#networkpolicytrafficdefault "Permanent link")

Default behaviors of network traffic in policies.

#### `DENY` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#deny "Permanent link")

The policy denies all traffic.

Since rules are additive, additional rules or policies can allow specific traffic.

---

#### `ALLOW` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#allow%5F3 "Permanent link")

The policy allows all traffic (either ingress or egress).

Since rules are additive, no additional rule or policies can subsequently deny the traffic.

---

The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.

ReadWriteOnce access mode still can allow multiple pods to access the volume when the pods are running on the same node.

---

#### `READ_ONLY_MANY` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#read%5Fonly%5Fmany "Permanent link")

The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.

---

#### `READ_WRITE_MANY` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#read%5Fwrite%5Fmany "Permanent link")

The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

---

#### `READ_WRITE_ONCE_POD` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#read%5Fwrite%5Fonce%5Fpod "Permanent link")

The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod.

Use ReadWriteOncePod access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across whole cluster can read that PVC or write to it. This is only supported for CSI volumes and Kubernetes version 1.22+.

---

### PersistentVolumeMode [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#persistentvolumemode "Permanent link")

Volume Modes.

#### `FILE_SYSTEM` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#file%5Fsystem "Permanent link")

Volume is ounted into Pods into a directory.

If the volume is backed by a block device and the device is empty, Kubernetes creates a filesystem on the device before mounting it for the first time.

---

#### `BLOCK` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#block "Permanent link")

Use a volume as a raw block device.

Such volume is presented into a Pod as a block device, without any filesystem on it. This mode is useful to provide a Pod the fastest possible way to access a volume, without any filesystem layer between the Pod and the volume. On the other hand, the application running in the Pod must know how to handle a raw block device

---

### PersistentVolumeReclaimPolicy [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#persistentvolumereclaimpolicy "Permanent link")

Reclaim Policies.

#### `RETAIN` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#retain "Permanent link")

The Retain reclaim policy allows for manual reclamation of the resource.

When the PersistentVolumeClaim is deleted, the PersistentVolume still exists and the volume is considered “released”. But it is not yet available for another claim because the previous claimant’s data remains on the volume. An administrator can manually reclaim the volume with the following steps:

1. Delete the PersistentVolume. The associated storage asset in external infrastructure (such as an AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or Cinder volume) still exists after the PV is deleted.
2. Manually clean up the data on the associated storage asset accordingly.
3. Manually delete the associated storage asset.

If you want to reuse the same storage asset, create a new PersistentVolume with the same storage asset definition.

---

#### `DELETE` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#delete "Permanent link")

For volume plugins that support the Delete reclaim policy, deletion removes both the PersistentVolume object from Kubernetes, as well as the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure, such as an AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or Cinder volume.

Volumes that were dynamically provisioned inherit the reclaim policy of their StorageClass, which defaults to Delete. The administrator should configure the StorageClass according to users’ expectations; otherwise, the PV must be edited or patched after it is created

---

### PodConnectionsIsolation [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#podconnectionsisolation "Permanent link")

Isolation determines which policies are created when allowing connections from a a pod / workload to peers.

#### `POD` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#pod%5F1 "Permanent link")

Only creates network policies that select the pod.

---

#### `PEER` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#peer "Permanent link")

Only creates network policies that select the peer.

---

### PodManagementPolicy [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#podmanagementpolicy "Permanent link")

Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down.

The default policy is `OrderedReady`, where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order.

The alternative policy is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once.

#### `ORDERED_READY` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#ordered%5Fready "Permanent link")

---

#### `PARALLEL` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#parallel "Permanent link")

---

#### `NEVER` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#never%5F1 "Permanent link")

Never restart the pod.

---

### ScalingStrategy [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#scalingstrategy "Permanent link")

#### `MAX_CHANGE` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#max%5Fchange "Permanent link")

Use the policy that provisions the most changes.

---

#### `MIN_CHANGE` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#min%5Fchange "Permanent link")

Use the policy that provisions the least amount of changes.

---

#### \~\~`DISABLED`\~\~ [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#disabled "Permanent link")

The container runtime default profile should be used.

---

#### `UNCONFINED` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#unconfined "Permanent link")

No profile should be applied.

---

### ServiceType [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#servicetype "Permanent link")

For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that’s outside of your cluster.

Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP.

#### `CLUSTER_IP` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#cluster%5Fip "Permanent link")

Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP.

Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType

---

#### `NODE_PORT` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#node%5Fport "Permanent link")

Exposes the Service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort).

A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You’ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting :.

---

#### `LOAD_BALANCER` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#load%5Fbalancer "Permanent link")

Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created.

---

#### `EXTERNAL_NAME` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#external%5Fname "Permanent link")

Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up.

> Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.

---

### TaintEffect [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#tainteffect "Permanent link")

Taint effects.

#### `NO_SCHEDULE` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#no%5Fschedule "Permanent link")

This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto the node unless it has a matching toleration.

---

#### `PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#prefer%5Fno%5Fschedule "Permanent link")

This is a “preference” or “soft” version of `NO_SCHEDULE` – the system will try to avoid placing a pod that does not tolerate the taint on the node, but it is not required.

---

#### `NO_EXECUTE` [¶](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/reference/cdk8s-plus-29/typescript/#no%5Fexecute "Permanent link")

This affects pods that are already running on the node as follows:.

Pods that do not tolerate the taint are evicted immediately. - Pods that tolerate the taint without specifying `duration` remain bound forever. - Pods that tolerate the taint with a specified `duration` remain bound for the specified amount of time.
